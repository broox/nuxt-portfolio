Its primary purpose is to catalog my life and allow me to play with various APIs and web development technologies.

Since 2001, it has been a constantly evolving web application.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 data-v-5a1319b8>v8 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-5a1319b8>This is the first version of my site that I completely rebuilt in a new language and platform. I moved the entire site from a containerized LAMP stack to a server-side-rendered (SSR) Nuxt.js application that relies completely on the <a href="/projects/broox-api/">Broox API</a> to power its content.

I chose Nuxt and SSR in order to keep my SEO and open graph / social sharing meta tags intact while still providing a speedy, asynchronous client-side browsing experience.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>7 previous versions <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v7 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2012</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.364d79a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.54d40e2.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>After learning about responsive web design during the Obama campaign, I rebuilt the front-end of derek.broox.com to be leaner and work better on mobile devices.

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.

Visually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.

With the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v4 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2004</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.80c98f7.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.fd825be.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was simply a reason to learn more about design with Cascading Style Sheets.  

Though this design did include a couple back-end changes, I focused mainly on design.  I definitely accomplished what I set out for in that I learned a great deal about using CSS effectively.

Major back-end code additions included tagging and paging for photos.

Throughout this design's life there were several add-ons made.  Some were back-end changes, most were content changes.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v3 <span data-v-eac61cc4>September 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.cc1cf7f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.4d424b1.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was mostly just content and design changes.  I tried to simplify the design a bit while adding much more content, including audio, videos, a biography, and links to my friends' sites.  

One cool addition was that on the homepage I made the random photo of myself change to photos of friends when you hovered over links to their websites.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v2 <span data-v-eac61cc4>January 2002</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v2.2aba35e.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v2.e84c973.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>Version 2 of derek.broox.com was the first version of my blog on the subdomain: derek.broox.com.  Prior to that my blog resided at www.broox.com.

This version was mostly just  content and design changes.  I added some random photo functionality to the site that would load random pictures of me in the homepage header, and random pictures of other things on other pages.

This app lived in several places - most notably at the hilariously named gottaregister.com, which was mentioned by President Obama in several speeches, on television, within social media and even on reddit.

In most states, this application basically acted as a fancy PDF filler that the user could print and mail in. However, it also allowed us to capture their information so that we could follow up and target that potential voter in the future.

I inherited this application early-on and was in charge of making sure it was both stable and scalable while overseeing implementation of the campaign's evolving feature requests. It was one of the most interesting applications to scale because it rarely received organic traffic. It would get absolutely slammed when the president or some celebrity mentioned or linked to the application in speeches, on air, or in social media.

This was addressed by extensive caching, limiting dynamic content on landing pages, and queueing API requests in the event of API downtime or latency. The queueing backup that I implemented (using Amazon's SQS) saved us thousands of voter registrations alone.

We also made this application embeddable and eventually open sourced the core of it.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/call-tool/" data-v-5a1319b8>Call Tool</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2012-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2012</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-5a1319b8>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/python/" data-v-5a1319b8>Python</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/call-tool.98108e2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/call-tool.0bf3dcd.gif" alt="Screenshot of Call Tool" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Call Tool is a phone canvassing web application used by both Obama for America and the DNC. In its simplest form, it provided volunteers with a potential voter to call and a relevant script to read. The volunteer could then record the answers from the potential voter, which were used to learn more about how the campaign should be operating or targeting individuals.

Underneath its shell, Call Tool had a fairly complex architecture that proxied all of its data through our Narwhal API and interfaced with a Voter Checkout Service API and synced with 2 of the campaign's vendors.

I architected and built the Call Tool web application and its communication with the Narwhal API from the ground up. I also extended several parts of the Voter Checkout Service to make it more performant, tighten protection against fraudulent callers, and better integrate with our vendors.

With that, the campaign put a huge effort into cataloging voting locations and making sure voters had the tools they needed to find these locations.

As the lead engineer of voter contact I architected and built the data layers, integration tools, and APIs to allow client applications to get at the data. I worked very closely with our data team, the DNC, voting location experts, and our front-end team.

Despite the incredible challenges that came with the constantly evolving, incomplete/disorganized data and different laws/rules in each state, we built a comprehensive, nation-wide election day lookup tool. In addition to that, we built the first ever nation-wide "early vote" lookup tools.

Not only was this data available via online lookup tools, it also integrated with DNC applications and allowed our phone canvassing applications to automatically display relevant voting locations for the canvassed voter.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/narwhal/" data-v-5a1319b8>Narwhal</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2012-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2012</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/api-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>API Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/python/" data-v-5a1319b8>Python</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/narwhal.6ef76fe.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/narwhal.5e9cdfd.gif" alt="Screenshot of Narwhal" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Narwhal was the famous technology infrastructure behind Barack Obama's 2012 Re-election campaign. It was a Python-based interface and integration layer that allowed us to unify the disconnected pieces of what we knew about voters, volunteers, event-goers, voting locations, etc. I was one of the top 5 contributors to the Narwhal project.

The integration side was a small web layer that handled syncing data with our vendors in real-time. Incoming data was saved to a local database and then became queued via SQS for translation and loading (by our integration workers) into the Narwhal interface layer. Here, I extended existing integrations and built some parts to sync voter applicant and precinct data.

The interface side allowed us to use this unified data to quickly build dozens of client applications for various tasks across the campaign. I spent most of my time in Narwhal building and extending models and endpoints to support client application needs. The pieces I worked on helped support pollster surveys, phone canvassing, volunteer organizing, image processing, voting location lookup, incident tracking, etc.

I also built a thin Ruby Gem that allowed our ruby based API consumer applications to quickly and easily interface with the Narwhal API.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/debate-watch/" data-v-5a1319b8>Debate Watch</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2011-12-05" data-v-5a1319b8>December 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/debate-watch.bed4574.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/debate-watch.6ed4a01.gif" alt="Screenshot of Debate Watch" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Debate Watch was a web application loosely based on Planned Parenthood's "Pledge a Protestor" program. The basic idea is that you make your opposition pay for negative actions by allowing your supporters to pledge money each time the opposition attempts slander.

With Debate Watch, we took some of the Republican candidates' favorite demeaning terms and promoted them on our site along with some fact checking. Obama supporters could then pledge to donate a certain amount of money each time a given word was said during the debate, and of course put a max cap on their donation in case something got out of control.

We had a team of word trackers stuffed in a room listening to the debate and tallying the terms in real-time. On the website's front-end the words would then re-arrange and scale in real-time as our pledgers watched.

I built the entire back-end of the application along with the word tracker and a small JSON API for consumption by our front-end team.

This application was built primarily as an experiment to test some of our scaling and payment infrastructure but managed to be quite fun and also earned us tens of thousands of dollars early on.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/artworks/" data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2011-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/artworks.96a0456.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/artworks.655d08d.gif" alt="Screenshot of Artworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks was a web application that allowed Obama supporters to vote on items in a contest.

We built an incredible web-based tool that allowed users to create, share, embed and collaborate on interactive timelines that integrated video, audio, images, text, social media, geolocation and of course, accurate timestamps. Timeline viewers could pan around and zoom into these timelines for a very nice, visually engaging experience.

Version 2 was a couple years old.  The design was dated, its timeline widget was built on the YUI library, and was generally inefficient.

Dipity 3's goal was to update the look, improve the widget's efficiency, support HTML5 guidelines, function on mobile devices, and provide several new features.

I built the front-end from the ground up, added several new features in both the front and back end (including Facebook connect, better registration process, etc), and worked closely with our other part-time engineer on the completely rewritten javascript timeline widget.

I spent a lot of time making sure that the new Dipity timeline widget worked on mobile devices such as androids, iPhones, and iPads.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>1 previous version <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v2 <span data-v-eac61cc4>January 2010</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.2c33da0.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.25080a2.gif" alt="Screenshot of Dipity" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>Dipity was originally a Facebook app. Version 2 was its reincarnation as a full fledged web application.

I was actually hired at Dipity to help phase out Dipity 2 and reinvent the software.

During the building of Dipity 3, things on Dipity 2 obviously needed maintained. Most of my work on 2.0 was related to bug fixes, client support, updating ad providers, or updating the widget to support new video players and sources.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div></div></div> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/harper-soundboard/" data-v-5a1319b8>Harper Soundboard</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2010-02-26" data-v-5a1319b8>February 2010</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/android/" data-v-5a1319b8>Android</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/java/" data-v-5a1319b8>Java</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/harper-soundboard.afcd2ae.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/harper-soundboard.af7728f.gif" alt="Screenshot of Harper Soundboard" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Several years ago, my friend Harper Reed figured out a way to hack into my phone (from a few hundred miles away) and change my voicemail... and at the time of writing this app - I still hadn't changed it.

So this was my app... it's pretty dumb, but it was a great intro to Android development.  Plus, I got to brush up on some Java.

I published this app to the Android market as a free app. Within the first week, I had around 250 downloads, about 60% of which uninstalled the application shortly after playing with it, haha.

This scheduler allowed Perficut to define a season, serviceable neighborhoods, average appointment times, the number of crews available, and other small details. From here, the tool allowed Perficut to assign crews to neighborhoods (based on stats from the previous season).

Jon simply uploaded photos and created albums on Flickr and those would become automatically mirrored to the portfolio on SmithsonWoodworks.com.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/mary-mcadams/" data-v-5a1319b8>Mary McAdams</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-11-30" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/wordpress/" data-v-5a1319b8>Wordpress</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/mary-mcadams.a2bc0dc.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/mary-mcadams.a7fca00.gif" alt="Screenshot of Mary McAdams" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Mary McAdams is a Des Moines area folk artist who was becoming super well known in the area. Mary hired my friend Mindy Hoskin as her designer - and Mindy approached me to bring her designs to life.

Having a small web budget and not a lot of time, I used this opportunity to brush up my WordPress skills.

I was able to build Mindy's designs out into a WordPress template and still keep a lot of the custom functionality that Mary wanted.

Along with her blog, Mary also wanted a lot of multimedia - photos, video, a music player, show times, downloads, etc.

For photos, I was able to customize one of the many WordPress Flickr plugins to work with Mindy's design.

Show times and the Music player were powered by Mary's ReverbNation account.  To make show times work, I hooked her ReverbNation calendar RSS feed to FeedBurner BuzzBoost and embedded the generated BuzzBoost into her blog accordingly.

Combined with Mary's active social networking, I think we were successful in getting all of her info in front of an audience in an elegant way.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/holiday-ecards/" data-v-5a1319b8>Holiday eCards</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-11-30" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/xml/" data-v-5a1319b8>XML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/holiday-ecards-v2.dc7e5a8.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/holiday-ecards-v2.fddfbf1.gif" alt="Screenshot of Holiday eCards" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>This is a microsite that I built as a marketing tool for malls owned by PREIT.

The site allowed subscribed companies to manage their assets, map routes, and calculate profit margins for every tow.  It was built in a way that allowed the towing companies to quickly run these calculations while on the phone, so they could figure out the most profitable way to charge for each tow.

On this project, I was in charge of pretty much everything except for the initial design.  My job involved data modeling, loads of calculations, back-end development, front-end development, form design, and deployment.

TowRate was a very javascript heavy application, using plenty of asynchronous calls for things like sorting, calculating rates on the fly, and grabbing map data from the Google Maps API.  The Maps API was used to help determine mileage and time for each tow.  From there, the app used extensive math and formulas to help find the best price for each call.

Companies were able subscribe to TowRate on a monthly or yearly basis.  I integrated PayPal's Web Payments Pro to handle these subscriptions; let users join, autorenew, enter discount codes, cancel accounts, etc.

Subscribed companies could also manage their trucks (as well as truck expenses), users, tow rates, tax areas, routes, etc.  It provided an all around fleet management solution to any towing company.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/west-bank/" data-v-5a1319b8>West Bank</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-08-11" data-v-5a1319b8>August 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-5a1319b8>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/west-bank.84a81f5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/west-bank.b65bad0.gif" alt="Screenshot of West Bank" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>West Bank is an Iowa based bank that my company, Red 5 Interactive, had been working with for years.

Our company, Red 5 Interactive had hosted IABD for years.  Up until this rebuild, they were one of the very last Java based sites running on an ancient server stuck in a closet in the back of our office. As time went on, it became scarier and scarier to let their site remain live. Once showing IABD the physical server they were running on, talking them into a complete rebuild was no challenge at all.

One of the most daunting parts of this rebuild was the task of migrating all their content. I heavily modified our internal <a href="/projects/site-spider/">Site Spider</a> to accomplish this task. The client had around 400 pages and 700 files that were linked to (mostly PDF press releases). I had to completely crawl their site, import everything into our CMS and fix every link to work correctly. Given the fact that they had FTP access to the old server, things were a mess, and this was not a simple task. I'm talking about some serious site scraping madness!

Being such a large site, this client came up with all kinds of awesome ideas for our CMS, which I was able to add-on and commit back to the repository for our other clients.

After setting up our internal CMS and importing their hundreds of pages/files, I had to build a Javascript Fund counter to display on their homepage.  Basically, the client takes their projected income, enters it into a custom tool that I built in <a href="/projects/siteman/">SiteMan</a>, and my JS did the math to determine how much money was being transferred to the state every second.  It then dynamically animated a count-<i>up</i> on the homepage.

I also built some fancy, custom (and totally dynamic) javascript dropdown navigation.

Finally, I had to model and build a custom plugin to allow IABD to import CSV files of their alcohol products, stores, and tobacco compliance data.  Then, I built functionality to browse and search all of this data on the front-end.

At the time, Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division was basically a test of all my skills. Sys admin, back-end development, front-end development, scraping, importing, and finally deployment.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/loffredo-fresh-produce/" data-v-5a1319b8>Loffredo Fresh Produce</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-05-13" data-v-5a1319b8>May 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/scriptaculous/" data-v-5a1319b8>script.aculo.us</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-5a1319b8>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/loffredo-fresh-produce.97c3755.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/loffredo-fresh-produce.eb3a973.gif" alt="Screenshot of Loffredo Fresh Produce" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Loffredo is a high-end produce company serving much of the Mid West.

The former host of michaelannett.com was not very cooperative in the site transition - so we had an interesting time getting Michael's content for him.

To get Michael's site, we wrote an internal app called <a href="/projects/site-spider/">Site Spider</a> to crawl his existing site, save all the pages, their images, stylesheets, javascripts, etc - all while preserving the links and folder structure.  Once I successfully crawled and downloaded this site, I put this app into our internal Content Management application, <a href="/projects/siteman/">SiteMan</a>.

I also built a couple custom SiteMan plugins, which included a photo gallery and online store management.

The store they wanted was fairly small, however, no matter the size, building an online store is quite an effort.

After launch, Michael was able to easily update news, photo galleries, results, schedules, general web page content at anytime, and could sell his gear online.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/ftthcap-conference/" data-v-5a1319b8>FTTHCAP Conference</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-03-04" data-v-5a1319b8>March 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-5a1319b8>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/ftthcap-conference.9d0d5f6.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/ftthcap-conference.94cf179.gif" alt="Screenshot of FTTHCAP Conference" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Fibre To The Home Council Asian Pacific (FTTHCAP) is a non-profit organization aiming to promote and accelerate Fibre To The Home - obviously in the Asian Pacific.

Once the design had been built out, my job was to stick everything into our internal CMS application, <a href="/projects/siteman/">SiteMan</a>, and get it deployed ASAP.

This was our first installment of SiteMan on a single site system, so it was a great trial run.  Despite a couple "gotchas," I was able to push this site out with our SiteMan CMS very rapidly.  During this launch I was also able to fix up some loose-ends that I found in SiteMan, thus enhancing our internal application even further.

After the launch, FTTH was able to easily edit any and all content via WYSIWYG editors.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/site-spider/" data-v-5a1319b8>Site Spider</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-03-02" data-v-5a1319b8>March 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/scraping/" data-v-5a1319b8>Scraping</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><!----> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Site Spider is an internal application that we wrote at Red 5 Interactive.

One challenge we faced with this project was PREIT's constant seasonal marketing campaigns and presentation layer redesigns. As such, we built SiteMan so that new presentation packages could easily be added into SiteMan for each of these campaigns.

It was originally built so that mall property owners could manage each of their mall property's websites.  However, once we realized how powerful our system was, we decided to generalize the app so that we could deploy it for all of our clients.

We rebuilt SiteMan to allow our clients to easily manage a single website or a group of websites. This way, a parent company could edit any of their child company websites, while employees of the child companies would only be able to see and manage their respective site.

The front-ends of the sites managed by SiteMan were also completely extracted from SiteMan itself, which was great for 2 reasons. First of all, it allowed us to more easily keep all of our clients' systems up-to-date in that we were just updating SiteMan and not touching their presentation layer. Secondly, it also allowed us to launch new campaigns and designs for clients very quickly without touching the content management system.

When we deployed SiteMan for a client it came with a core group of tools like user management, web page editing, file management, audit logs, etc.  From there, custom tools could be added as plugins.  These tools included functionality like, announcements, events, careers, photo galleries, stores, social networking, etc.

We also built SiteMan in a way that allowed users to customize their tool layout. Any user could pick which tools they used the most and arrange them in a way to get a quick snapshot of the exact data that they were interested in. Tools could be added, removed, or sorted at any time - and everything remained just as they left it on their next visit.  

This application was very Javascript heavy, making extensive use AJAX, dialog windows, and WYSIWYG editing.  As such, we had minimal page loads which provided a very streamlined experience for our clients.

I am very proud and excited to have worked with such a great team on this app.  It was so versatile and simple to keep pushing forward.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/napa-sales-driver/" data-v-5a1319b8>NAPA Sales Driver</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-02-02" data-v-5a1319b8>February 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/e-commerce/" data-v-5a1319b8>E-Commerce</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-5a1319b8>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/payflow-pro/" data-v-5a1319b8>Payflow Pro</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/paypal/" data-v-5a1319b8>PayPal</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/scraping/" data-v-5a1319b8>Scraping</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/napa-sales-driver.14f7e88.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/napa-sales-driver.a3aa19b.gif" alt="Screenshot of NAPA Sales Driver" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Edwards Graphics Arts (a partner to NAPA) hired our company to build a web application for distributing posters and flyers to NAPA's retail stores.

Broomball is a sport similar to hockey but a bit more recreational.

Once my Broomball league caught wind of me being a well-connected, tech savvy guy, they nominated me to be the Marketing Director.

As marketing director my main purpose was to help promote the league - and what better way to do that than to build a fancy website.

Not having hardly any time to devote to this project, I decided to try out a product that I'd heard a bit about, called Drupal.

The Drupal Content Management System was a pretty great little app.  I literally had a community site up and running within an hour.  The Drupal community had written so many modules, that I didn't have to write a single line of code to get the site off the ground.

After installing a handful of modules, a bit of layout tweaking, and modifying a tiny bit of PHP, we had a completely functional site.

I even got the help of designer Kathryn Downing to whip up that logo in a matter of about 25 minutes.

I wouldn't use Drupal for everything, but it was definitely an excellent solution for this project. The site helped the league gain players and teams for our regional tournaments.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/tmc-transportation/" data-v-5a1319b8>TMC Transportation</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2008-12-02" data-v-5a1319b8>December 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/xml/" data-v-5a1319b8>XML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/tmc-transportation.73f8fc4.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/tmc-transportation.bbf2f78.gif" alt="Screenshot of TMC Transportation" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>TMC, a local trucking company with some of the most beautiful trucks that I've ever seen, hired us to rebuild their website and enhance their web presence.

It was awesome until a terrible song would come on and I'd have to run upstairs to skip to a better tune.

Apple quickly became aware of this problem and released an iTunes remote for iOS. However, at the time I didn't have any iOS devices and I couldn't justify spending a few hundred dollars for an ipod touch/iphone music remote. As such, I decided to build a remote of my own.

Using PHP and AppleScript to communicate to iTunes, I was able to whip up a super light web-based remote that ran on my Mac.  With "LAMP" running locally, I could visit the IP of my Mac from any device on my internal network and navigate my songs.

At the time, I used this to switch songs via my blackberry, sidekick, a PSP, or even our Nintendo Wii.  It was great for parties!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/keokuk-county-state-bank/" data-v-5a1319b8>Keokuk County State Bank</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2008-07-30" data-v-5a1319b8>July 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/keokuk-county-state-bank.2320da2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/keokuk-county-state-bank.ef42d5e.gif" alt="Screenshot of Keokuk County State Bank" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Keokuk came to us with a redesign in mind and also wanted the ability to easily update loan rates, add news articles, and attach rich media to those news articles.

Keokuk's website wasn't too programmatically intensive, but it did give me an opportunity to try out some new Rails ideas.

While building this app, I found a Rails plugin called ActiveScaffold, which made a standard CRUD scaffold that was very javascript heavy with a lot of asynchronous calls and very few page loads. It was a fun plugin to play with and after a bit of modifying and extending, it seemed to fit the bill for this project.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/adium-status-plugin/" data-v-5a1319b8>Adium Status Plugin</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2008-07-13" data-v-5a1319b8>July 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/adium-status-plugin.6704481.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/adium-status-plugin.e4ad311.gif" alt="Screenshot of Adium Status Plugin" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Adium was a multi-protocol chat client for Mac OS. I enjoyed it because it let me connect to AIM, Google Talk, ICQ, and other popular chat clients from the early/mid-2000s.

Shortly after getting Adium I installed a TwitterAdium plugin (aka Xtra) that would set my current status to whatever my most recent tweet was. The problem that I had with this plugin was that I had too many apps hooked to my Twitter account and was running into rate limiting issues on their API. I had derek.broox.com, Facebook, MySpace, and Adium all hitting Twitter, which made them sad.

Since derek.broox.com grabbed and cached my Twitter status, I decided to be nicer to Twitter and write an Adium plugin to grab my status from derek.broox.com. 

I built the plugin with Ruby and made it configurable via YAML. I simply defined the url and duration in the included YAML file and set my Adium status to %_RemoteStatus. That would then periodically hit my website to fetch my status and allow all of my chat contacts to follow what I was doing while I was on the go.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/cownie-for-state-house/" data-v-5a1319b8>Cownie For State House</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2008-06-10" data-v-5a1319b8>June 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/flickr-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Flickr API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/cownie-for-state-house.5a28003.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/cownie-for-state-house.e58bb59.gif" alt="Screenshot of Cownie For State House" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Iowa Republican Peter Cownie hired our company to build a promotional website during the 2008 election.

Glimcher wanted a near real-time display of their stock price on the homepage. However, there weren't any great services to grab this information at the time, so I built a CRON scheduled script to scrape a couple quote sites and grab their stock price.  Whenever the price was successfully grabbed, the price was written to a local file that was read by the website.

Glimcher also wanted real-time stats on their leasing informational pages, so I added some functionality to display updates on leasable square feet, property count, etc.

Finally, they wanted to be able to quickly show/hide all dynamic content on their website.

When we built sites for clients, it was often helpful to track all administrative actions that took place in their content management systems. This allowed us to easily troubleshoot content issues - accidentally deleted data, bad actors, security breaches, etc.

We were duplicating much of this functionality for several clients, so I whipped up an Audit Trail app. I built it so that it could be deployed in 2 separate ways. The first, and most commonly used way was for our client applications to call a centrally hosted Audit Trail as a service.  With most of our clients hitting the same service, we could keep a close eye on what all of our clients were doing.

The second way was to install the Audit Trail as a separate app for any given client. We generally only did this if we anticipated a large amount of logs, or if we had a client that managed several sites.

The app and service was incredibly useful. Our clients really enjoyed being able to easily see what was being updated and who did the updating.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/countryside-rv/" data-v-5a1319b8>Countryside RV</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2008-01-24" data-v-5a1319b8>January 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/countryside-rv.073077a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/countryside-rv.af69ff2.gif" alt="Screenshot of Countryside RV" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Countryside RV was my first complete Ruby on Rails site.

I worked graphic designer, Mindy Hoskin, for the graphic elements, which are taken primarily from the album art that she designed.

I also did some of Aeon Grey's photography and videography.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/truespin-media/" data-v-5a1319b8>Truespin Media</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2006-03-29" data-v-5a1319b8>March 2006</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/truespin-media-v2.336a26c.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/truespin-media-v2.ed097b4.gif" alt="Screenshot of Truespin Media" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Truespin Media was a small partnership that my friend, Nick Leeper, and I started up to work on side-gigs.

The site allowed visitors to check out their bios, video, photos, and most importantly, their music.

Even though it was just a joke. We ended up having approximately 50,000 visitors in the first 48hrs and peaked at 100,000 visitors in the first week. We then switched it up and served large political content to the blogger demograph and pulled 3.7 terabytes of transfer in 5 days.

I was in charge of the site's design and some of the creative content.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/solid-grind/" data-v-5a1319b8>Solid Grind</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2003-05-28" data-v-5a1319b8>May 2003</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/e-commerce/" data-v-5a1319b8>E-Commerce</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/paypal/" data-v-5a1319b8>PayPal</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v2.c4a1729.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v2.78e0995.gif" alt="Screenshot of Solid Grind" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>SolidGrind is a personal project that I developed as an extreme sports / soap shoes promotional and community website. It's the predecessor of my former <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> (www.broox.com) and <a href="/projects/brooksfsw/">BrooksFSW</a> community sites.

After I came up with the name and domain, I decided that rather than customizing a prebuilt system, I wanted to build this site from scratch. Developing the entire site myself was another great learning experience and paid off numerous times; I had full control and a great understanding of the system, so I could easily add on, fix bugs, and rebuild sections.

One of the more fun parts of SolidGrind was the "feature pic" system. It allowed users to upload photos to be reviewed by the administrators that I'd hired. The uploaded photos were queued in a database and could be viewed/approved by administrators. Upon approval, the website would automatically size/scale the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to it, create a thumbnail, store it in the database, and feature the picture on the homepage until a new photo was chosen. In addition, I designed it so that each picture had to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gave everyone a fair amount of time on our front page.

Besides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 data-v-5a1319b8>v2 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-5a1319b8>In 2006, I re-released Solid Grind to get away from publishing broader extreme sports content and focus on the grind shoe scene. There were so many other extreme sports sites with a full staff dedicated to maintaining them, but no one had this thorough of a website dedicated to the grind shoe scene.

I worked with Nicole Sutherland on the design of this version, which turned out great for the content being delivered.

The new version of the site was much more complete, the code was much more efficient, and photo manipulation was handled much better.  With the initial version of SolidGrind I was very proud of the photo management system - this system was much cleaner and much more versatile in that most image manipulation was handled on the fly.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>1 previous version <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v1 <span data-v-eac61cc4>May 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.459171a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.7bdcc34.gif" alt="Screenshot of Solid Grind" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>The first version of SolidGrind was dedicated to several types of extreme sports.

At the time there were several sites offering this service however nearly all of them only supported one type of phone or charged money for each wallpaper downloaded (usually $1.00 per wallpaper). Wireless Wallpapers allowed users to download unlimited wallpapers for free, which were available for several types of phones. The free wallpapers had a tiny "wirelesswallpapers" watermarks near the bottom of the image, however if the user paid a small fee each month, they could get more features (such as private wallpapers) and the watermark was removed. In addition to this, I added functionality to allow users to upload their own images to the website which gave me the ability to let the site run itself. The website automatically resized the uploaded user images to fit various mobile screen sizes and printed my watermark to the image. The site was a huge success and learning experience. The first day it was online it received 7,000 hits and had nearly 100 users. After the first week there were nearly 50,000 hits and 500 users.  Upon selling the site, I had over 24,000 users and received over 3,200,000 hits.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/james-h-laas-company/" data-v-5a1319b8>James H.

At the time, it was one of the largest, most complex, and complete systems that I'd built. 

Prior to my development, they made all of their updates by updating static HTML files - a content management system was very much needed. They had a huge amount of content and product information that became quite redundant in the way that they were displaying it. 

I designed a more aesthetically pleasing site powered by a PHP/MySQL back-end. With the new design, I concentrated mostly on the ease of navigation and finding vital information quickly, which was successfully attained. Their site became completely free of managing and uploading static files and was updateable via the CMS that I created. The database proved to be very useful as the James Laas company wrote several articles per month. This site was also the home of the first site wide search engines that I'd built.

Cornell introduced a new marketing scheme to give students information about the college, which was titled "The Simple Truth." The college had hundreds of pamphlets printed out, which they would send to everyone who visited truth.cornellcollege.edu. On top of that we even had an advertisement going into U.S. News, which had a link to the site I was supposed to build (hence the short deadline).

The site was only to be 1 page long, had to open in a static sized window, and needed to have a PHP based form to collect data and insert information into a database.  On top of all of that, they wanted flash animation for the header.

The program allowed users to choose whether they wanted to test their vocabulary from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English. I wrote functionality that retrieves a random word from the database every time they choose a new card. Once a card is selected it is cached and marked as 'viewed'. This would make sure the program goes through every card before it repeats one of the previous ones. It was also designed so the user could choose which type of words they wanted to learn.

They flew out from New York to do a day long photoshoot of us sliding on handrails, and we were all featured in the April, 2002 of YM magazine!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/brooksfsw/" data-v-5a1319b8>BrooksFSW</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2000-09-01" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2000</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/brooksfsw.99ed790.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/brooksfsw.917d192.gif" alt="Screenshot of BrooksFSW" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>BrooksFSW was a site dedicated to Soap Shoes, a company that makes shoes capable of sliding across objects such as handrails, benches, etc.  The activity of "soaping" is very similar to grinding with inline skates or skateboards.  I did promotional work for Soap Shoes for several years and this site was a huge part of that.

BrooksFSW was a portal site using PHP Nuke to develop a community for "Soapers."  It kept users informed on the latest news and happenings with the company.  It also kept everyone involved in friendly competition with photos, polls, forums, and videos.

This was the first site I ran that used an extensive PHP and MySQL back-end and was an excellent learning experience for me. My mentor, Harper Reed, helped tremendously with the initial setup and training. It was released in September 2000 and integrated into <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> in October 2001.  During that year it received nearly 620,000 hits and had 800 registered users.  The site also had 441 news articles published and over 6,000 comments on those articles.

BrooksFSW received some great recognition from large medias such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, The Mount Vernon Sun, The Rock Island Dispatch, and the Cedar Rapids Gazette.

I was hired as a technician and web master for the 2001-2002 school year.  As technician, I was in charge of setting up and running all audio/video equipment at our events.  As web master, I had complete reign over the site.

When I first joined this group the site was programmed via Macromedia Dream Weaver and was quite simple. I rebuilt the site from scratch, giving it a more uniform, professional look that was very easy to navigate.  I also integrated some Flash animation for aesthetics.

The color scheme may not have been the best, but it was our school colors and the overall layout turned out nice.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/computing-services/" data-v-5a1319b8>Computing Services</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2001" data-v-5a1319b8>2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/perl/" data-v-5a1319b8>Perl</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/computing-services.0ec4050.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/computing-services.89aa4ab.gif" alt="Screenshot of Computing Services" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>While at Cornell, I worked for Computing Services - the department that managed all of Information Technology.  As part of my work-study I was hired to design a site for our department.  It was my first experience in coding websites with things other than straight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I got to learn perl and the magic of including reusable .nav files for easy, DRY navigation manipulation.

My main duty was to fix old links, remove unwanted content, add new content, and update various items throughout.  Due to such a large amount of changes, I ended up recoding most of the site from scratch.  Everything except for the RESnet (student intranet) section of the website was my work.  At the time, if you saw a little stylized "x" in the footer the bottom of the page - I programmed it.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/advantage-group/" data-v-5a1319b8>Advantage Group</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2001" data-v-5a1319b8>2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/advantage-group.d27c10c.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/advantage-group.98bbc55.gif" alt="Screenshot of Advantage Group" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>The Advantage Group is an investment company based in Cedar Rapids Iowa.

The site turned out just as planned and served as a great tool for The Advantage Group.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/kappa-theta/" data-v-5a1319b8>Kappa Theta</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2000" data-v-5a1319b8>2000</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/kappa-theta.2b96e5d.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/kappa-theta.570aeea.gif" alt="Screenshot of Kappa Theta" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Kappa Theta is a female social group at Cornell College - Cornell's equivalent to a Sorority.

It turned out to be a very useful tool to easily communicate the message, purpose, and goals of the group.  5 years later, I ended up marrying one of them!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article></div></div></div> <footer data-v-ad506cea><div data-v-ad506cea>
