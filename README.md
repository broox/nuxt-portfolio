# Derek Brooks' Portfolio

This is a simple [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org) application to showcase some things that I've built throughout my career.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
yarn run dev
```

or, to open the site in a browser while starting the server

```bash
yarn dev -o
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
yarn run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
yarn run preview
```

Checkout the [deployment documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/deploy/presets) for more information.
