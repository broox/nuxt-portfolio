I wrote functionality that retrieves a random word from the database every time they choose a new card. Once a card is selected it is cached and marked as 'viewed'. This would make sure the program goes through every card before it repeats one of the previous ones. It was also designed so the user could choose which type of words they wanted to learn.

On top of that we even had an advertisement going into U.S. News, which had a link to the site I was supposed to build (hence the short deadline).\n\nThe site was only to be 1 page long, had to open in a static sized window, and needed to have a PHP based form to collect data and insert information into a database.  On top of all of that, they wanted flash animation for the header.  The screenshot pictured is simply of the flash animation.",

Developing the entire site myself was another great learning experience and paid off numerous times; I had full control and a great understanding of the system, so I could easily add on, fix bugs, and rebuild sections.\n\nOne of the more fun parts of SolidGrind was the \"feature pic\" system. It allowed users to upload photos to be reviewed by the administrators that I'd hired. The uploaded photos were queued in a database and could be viewed/approved by administrators. Upon approval, the website would automatically size/scale the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to it, create a thumbnail, store it in the database, and feature the picture on the homepage until a new photo was chosen. In addition, I designed it so that each picture had to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gave everyone a fair amount of time on our front page.\n\nBesides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.",

The first, and most commonly used way was for our client applications to call a centrally hosted Audit Trail as a service.  With most of our clients hitting the same service, we could keep a close eye on what all of our clients were doing.\n\nThe second way was to install the Audit Trail as a separate app for any given client. We generally only did this if we anticipated a large amount of logs, or if we had a client that managed several sites.\n\nThe app and service was incredibly useful. Our clients really enjoyed being able to easily see what was being updated and who did the updating.",

I simply defined the url and duration in the included YAML file and set my Adium status to %_RemoteStatus.

It was originally built so that mall property owners could manage each of their mall property's websites.  However, once we realized how powerful our system was, we decided to generalize the app so that we could deploy it for all of our clients.\n\nWe rebuilt SiteMan to allow our clients to easily manage a single website or a group of websites. This way, a parent company could edit any of their child company websites, while employees of the child companies would only be able to see and manage their respective site.\n\nThe front-ends of the sites managed by SiteMan were also completely extracted from SiteMan itself, which was great for 2 reasons. First of all, it allowed us to more easily keep all of our clients' systems up-to-date in that we were just updating SiteMan and not touching their presentation layer. Secondly, it also allowed us to launch new campaigns and designs for clients very quickly without touching the content management system.\n\nWhen we deployed SiteMan for a client it came with a core group of tools like user management, web page editing, file management, audit logs, etc.  From there, custom tools could be added as plugins.  These tools included functionality like, announcements, events, careers, photo galleries, stores, social networking, etc.\n\nWe also built SiteMan in a way that allowed users to customize their tool layout. Any user could pick which tools they used the most and arrange them in a way to get a quick snapshot of the exact data that they were interested in. Tools could be added, removed, or sorted at any time - and everything remained just as they left it on their next visit.  \n\nThis application was very Javascript heavy, making extensive use AJAX, dialog windows, and WYSIWYG editing.  As such, we had minimal page loads which provided a very streamlined experience for our clients.\n\nI am very proud and excited to have worked with such a great team on this app.  It was so versatile and simple to keep pushing forward.",

The division has generated hundreds of millions of dollars for the state of Iowa.\n\nOur company, Red 5 Interactive had hosted IABD for years.  Up until this rebuild, they were one of the very last Java based sites running on an ancient server stuck in a closet in the back of our office. As time went on, it became scarier and scarier to let their site remain live. Once showing IABD the physical server they were running on, talking them into a complete rebuild was no challenge at all.\n\nOne of the most daunting parts of this rebuild was the task of migrating all their content. I heavily modified our internal Site Spider to accomplish this task. The client had around 400 pages and 700 files that were linked to (mostly PDF press releases). I had to completely crawl their site, import everything into our CMS and fix every link to work correctly. Given the fact that they had FTP access to the old server, things were a mess, and this was not a simple task. I'm talking about some serious site scraping madness!\n\nBeing such a large site, this client came up with all kinds of awesome ideas for our CMS, which I was able to add-on and commit back to the repository for our other clients.\n\nAfter setting up our internal CMS and importing their hundreds of pages/files, I had to build a Javascript Fund counter to display on their homepage.  Basically, the client takes their projected income, enters it into a custom tool that I built in SiteMan, and my JS did the math to determine how much money was being transferred to the state every second.  It then dynamically animated a count-<i>up</i> on the homepage.\n\nI also built some fancy, custom (and totally dynamic) javascript dropdown navigation.\n\nFinally, I had to model and build a custom plugin to allow IABD to import CSV files of their alcohol products, stores, and tobacco compliance data.  Then, I built functionality to browse and search all of this data on the front-end.\n\nAt the time, Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division was basically a test of all my skills.

The pieces I worked on helped support pollster surveys, phone canvassing, volunteer organizing, image processing, voting location lookup, incident tracking, etc.\n\nI also built a thin Ruby Gem that allowed our ruby based API consumer applications to quickly and easily interface with the Narwhal API.",

The volunteer could then record the answers from the potential voter, which were used to learn more about how the campaign should be operating or targeting individuals.\n\nUnderneath its shell, Call Tool had a fairly complex architecture that proxied all of its data through our Narwhal API and interfaced with a Voter Checkout Service API and synced with 2 of the campaign's vendors.\n\nI architected and built the Call Tool web application and its communication with the Narwhal API from the ground up. I also extended several parts of the Voter Checkout Service to make it more performant, tighten protection against fraudulent callers, and better integrate with our vendors. As I took on other tasks on the campaign, I worked with other engineers and oversaw all development on the application.",

        "description": "Voter Registration SaaS was a thin, skinnable, multi-lingual, voter registration web application built on top of the DNC's Voter Registration API. This app lived in several places - most notably at the hilariously named gottaregister.com, which was mentioned by President Obama in several speeches, on television, within social media and even on reddit.\n\nIn most states, this application basically acted as a fancy PDF filler that the user could print and mail in. However, it also allowed us to capture their information so that we could follow up and target that potential voter in the future.\n\nI inherited this application early-on and was in charge of making sure it was both stable and scalable while overseeing implementation of the campaign's evolving feature requests. It was one of the most interesting applications to scale because it rarely received organic traffic. It would get absolutely slammed when the president or some celebrity mentioned or linked to the application in speeches, on air, or in social media.\n\nThis was addressed by extensive caching, limiting dynamic content on landing pages, and queueing API requests in the event of API downtime or latency. The queueing backup that I implemented (using Amazon's SQS) saved us thousands of voter registrations alone.\n\nWe also made this application embeddable and eventually open sourced the core of it.",

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.\n\nVisually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.\n\nWith the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.",
