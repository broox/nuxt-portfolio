After I came up with the name and domain, I decided that I wanted to code the entire thing from scratch, rather than customize a prebuilt system. Coding the entire site has paid off numerous times; I now have full control and understanding of the system and can add on, fix bugs, and rebuild very easily.\n\nOne of the most complex parts of SolidGrind was the \"feature pic\" system. It allowed users to upload pictures to be reviewed by the administrators I hired.  These pictures were queued in a database and could be viewed by the administrators. If we saw one we liked, we simply clicked a button to set it as the feature pic. This button contained functionality to automatically adjust the size of the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to each image, create a thumbnail of the image, store it in the database, and place the picture on the homepage until a new picture is added. In addition, I designed it so that each picture has to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gives everyone a fair amount of time on our frontpage.\n\nBesides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.","2003-05-28","wap","2002-09-26","perl",14,"2.48",10,"1.77",5));
