Its primary purpose is to catalog my life and allow me to play with various APIs and web development technologies. It serves up thousands of photos, check-ins, microblogs, blogs, maps, videos, and various other data from my life.

Since 2001, it has been a constantly evolving web application.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 data-v-1f91f03d>v8 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-1f91f03d>This is the first version of my site that I completely rebuilt in a new language and platform. I moved the entire site from a LAMP stack to a server-side-rendered (SSR) Nuxt.js application that relies completely on the Broox API to power its content.

I chose Nuxt and SSR in order to keep my SEO and open graph / social sharing meta tags intact while still providing a speedy, asynchronous client-side browsing experience.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 class="toggle" data-v-1f91f03d>7 previous versions <span data-v-1f91f03d></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-1f91f03d><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v7 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2012</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.364d79a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.54d40e2.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>After learning about responsive web design during the Obama campaign, I rebuilt the front-end of derek.broox.com to be leaner and work better on mobile devices.

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.

Visually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.

With the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v4 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2004</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.80c98f7.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.fd825be.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was simply a reason to learn more about design with Cascading Style Sheets.  

Though this design did include a couple back-end changes, I focused mainly on design.  I definitely accomplished what I set out for in that I learned a great deal about using CSS effectively.

Major back-end code additions included tagging and paging for photos.

Throughout this design's life there were several add-ons made.  Some were back-end changes, most were content changes.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v3 <span data-v-eac61cc4>September 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.cc1cf7f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.4d424b1.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was mostly just content and design changes.

Prior to that my blog resided at www.broox.com.

This version was mostly just  content and design changes.  I added some random photo functionality to the site that would load random pictures of me in the homepage header, and random pictures of other things on other pages.

In its simplest form, it provided volunteers with a potential voter to call and a relevant script to read. The volunteer could then record the answers from the potential voter, which were used to learn more about how the campaign should be operating or targeting individuals.

Underneath its shell, Call Tool had a fairly complex architecture that proxied all of its data through our Narwhal API and interfaced with a Voter Checkout Service API and synced with 2 of the campaign's vendors.

I architected and built the Call Tool web application and its communication with the Narwhal API from the ground up. I also extended several parts of the Voter Checkout Service to make it more performant, tighten protection against fraudulent callers, and better integrate with our vendors. As I took on other tasks on the campaign, I worked with other engineers and oversaw all development on the application.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/des-moines-alive/" data-v-1f91f03d>Des Moines Alive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2011-04-30" data-v-1f91f03d>April 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/foursquare-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Foursquare API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/google-maps-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Google Maps API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-1f91f03d>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-1f91f03d>JSON</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/simple-geo-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Simple Geo API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/twitter-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Twitter API</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-alive-v2.94a37e6.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-alive-v2.6f3c147.gif" alt="Screenshot of Des Moines Alive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Des Moines Alive is a personal project that my friend Nick Leeper and I built to help Des Moines Area folks find awesome local bars and restaurants.

We built an incredible web-based tool that allowed users to create, share, embed and collaborate on interactive timelines that integrated video, audio, images, text, social media, geolocation and of course, accurate timestamps. Timeline viewers could pan around and zoom into these timelines for a very nice, visually engaging experience. Being that it was all built in vanilla javascript, it even worked, and was incredibly responsive, on mobile devices, ipads, etc.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 data-v-1f91f03d>v3 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-1f91f03d>Building Dipity 3 is the main reason I was hired.

Version 2 was a couple years old.  The design was dated, its timeline widget was built on the YUI library, and was generally inefficient.

Dipity 3's goal was to update the look, improve the widget's efficiency, support HTML5 guidelines, function on mobile devices, and provide several new features.

I built the front-end from the ground up, added several new features in both the front and back end (including Facebook connect, better registration process, etc), and worked closely with our other part-time engineer on the completely rewritten javascript timeline widget.

I spent a lot of time making sure that the new Dipity timeline widget worked on mobile devices such as androids, iPhones, and iPads.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 class="toggle" data-v-1f91f03d>1 previous version <span data-v-1f91f03d></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-1f91f03d><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v2 <span data-v-eac61cc4>January 2010</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.2c33da0.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.25080a2.gif" alt="Screenshot of Dipity" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>Dipity was originally a Facebook app. Version 2 was its reincarnation as a full fledged web application.

Most of my work on 2.0 was related to bug fixes, client support, updating ad providers, or updating the widget to support new video players and sources.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div></div></div> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/perficut/" data-v-1f91f03d>Perficut</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2010-02-17" data-v-1f91f03d>February 2010</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-1f91f03d>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-1f91f03d>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/perficut.738ba4c.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/perficut.3a1fa21.gif" alt="Screenshot of Perficut" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Perficut is one of the leading landscaping and lawn service companies in Des Moines, IA.

In addition to a complete redesign built around our CMS, I also built a large custom irrigation and service scheduler for Perficut and their clients.

This scheduler allowed Perficut to define a season, serviceable neighborhoods, average appointment times, the number of crews available, and other small details. From here, the tool allowed Perficut to assign crews to neighborhoods (based on stats from the previous season). Once this was all set up, customers could visit Perficut's site to schedule sprinkler system startups, shutdowns, and service.

On top of this custom tool, I was also in charge of integrating this site into our SiteMan CMS and deploying the site.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/philadelphia-marketplace/" data-v-1f91f03d>Philadelphia Marketplace</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2010-01-11" data-v-1f91f03d>January 2010</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-1f91f03d>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/philadelphia-marketplace.551fc33.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/philadelphia-marketplace.d330135.gif" alt="Screenshot of Philadelphia Marketplace" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Philadelphia Marketplace is the shopping center located within Philadelphia International Airport.

The site allowed subscribed companies to manage their assets, map routes, and calculate profit margins for every tow.  It was built in a way that allowed the towing companies to quickly run these calculations while on the phone, so they could figure out the most profitable way to charge for each tow.

On this project, I was in charge of pretty much everything except for the initial design.  My job involved data modeling, loads of calculations, back-end development, front-end development, form design, and deployment.

TowRate was a very javascript heavy application, using plenty of asynchronous calls for things like sorting, calculating rates on the fly, and grabbing map data from the Google Maps API.  The Maps API was used to help determine mileage and time for each tow.  From there, the app used extensive math and formulas to help find the best price for each call.

Companies were able subscribe to TowRate on a monthly or yearly basis.  I integrated PayPal's Web Payments Pro to handle these subscriptions; let users join, autorenew, enter discount codes, cancel accounts, etc.

Subscribed companies could also manage their trucks (as well as truck expenses), users, tow rates, tax areas, routes, etc.  It provided an all around fleet management solution to any towing company.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/west-bank/" data-v-1f91f03d>West Bank</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-08-11" data-v-1f91f03d>August 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-1f91f03d>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/west-bank.84a81f5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/west-bank.b65bad0.gif" alt="Screenshot of West Bank" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>West Bank is an Iowa based bank that my company, Red 5 Interactive, had been working with for years.

Our company, Red 5 Interactive had hosted IABD for years.  Up until this rebuild, they were one of the very last Java based sites running on an ancient server stuck in a closet in the back of our office. As time went on, it became scarier and scarier to let their site remain live. Once showing IABD the physical server they were running on, talking them into a complete rebuild was no challenge at all.

One of the most daunting parts of this rebuild was the task of migrating all their content. I heavily modified our internal Site Spider to accomplish this task. The client had around 400 pages and 700 files that were linked to (mostly PDF press releases). I had to completely crawl their site, import everything into our CMS and fix every link to work correctly. Given the fact that they had FTP access to the old server, things were a mess, and this was not a simple task. I'm talking about some serious site scraping madness!

Being such a large site, this client came up with all kinds of awesome ideas for our CMS, which I was able to add-on and commit back to the repository for our other clients.

After setting up our internal CMS and importing their hundreds of pages/files, I had to build a Javascript Fund counter to display on their homepage.  Basically, the client takes their projected income, enters it into a custom tool that I built in SiteMan, and my JS did the math to determine how much money was being transferred to the state every second.  It then dynamically animated a count-<i>up</i> on the homepage.

I also built some fancy, custom (and totally dynamic) javascript dropdown navigation.

Finally, I had to model and build a custom plugin to allow IABD to import CSV files of their alcohol products, stores, and tobacco compliance data.  Then, I built functionality to browse and search all of this data on the front-end.

At the time, Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division was basically a test of all my skills. Sys admin, back-end development, front-end development, scraping, importing, and finally deployment.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/loffredo-fresh-produce/" data-v-1f91f03d>Loffredo Fresh Produce</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-05-13" data-v-1f91f03d>May 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/scriptaculous/" data-v-1f91f03d>script.aculo.us</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-1f91f03d>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/loffredo-fresh-produce.97c3755.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/loffredo-fresh-produce.eb3a973.gif" alt="Screenshot of Loffredo Fresh Produce" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Loffredo is a high-end produce company serving much of the Mid West.

The fruit carousel I mentioned was a custom javascript animation that cycles through various fruits on the homepage.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/michael-annett/" data-v-1f91f03d>Michael Annett</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-03-09" data-v-1f91f03d>March 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/authorize-net/" data-v-1f91f03d>Authorize.Net</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/e-commerce/" data-v-1f91f03d>E-Commerce</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/siteman/" data-v-1f91f03d>SiteMan</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/michael-annett.447620d.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/michael-annett.454bc89.gif" alt="Screenshot of Michael Annett" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Michael Annett was an upcoming race car driver from Des Moines, IA.  We didn't build his site from scratch, but when his site development/hosting company stopped providing good service, we were asked to take over.  The former host of michaelannett.com was not very cooperative in the site transition - so we had an interesting time getting Michael's content for him.

To get Michael's site, we wrote an internal app called <a href="/projects/site-spider/">Site Spider</a> to crawl his existing site, save all the pages, their images, stylesheets, javascripts, etc - all while preserving the links and folder structure.  Once I successfully crawled and downloaded this site, I put this app into our internal Content Management application, <a href="/projects/siteman/">SiteMan</a>.

I also built a couple custom SiteMan plugins, which included a photo gallery and online store management.

The store they wanted was fairly small, however, no matter the size, building an online store is quite an effort.

After launch, Michael was able to easily update news, photo galleries, results, schedules, general web page content at anytime, and could sell his gear online.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/sc-automotive/" data-v-1f91f03d>S & C Automotive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-02-11" data-v-1f91f03d>February 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/extjs/" data-v-1f91f03d>ExtJS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-1f91f03d>JSON</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.be6a206.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.2487f5b.gif" alt="Screenshot of S & C Automotive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>S & C Automotive is a company that provides vehicle warranties and protections to local car dealerships.

I built a web application to allow S & C to manage these protections and offer them to dealerships. The dealerships had their own accounts and could log in and select each protection that they sell.

It was originally built so that mall property owners could manage each of their mall property's websites.  However, once we realized how powerful our system was, we decided to generalize the app so that we could deploy it for all of our clients.

We rebuilt SiteMan to allow our clients to easily manage a single website or a group of websites. This way, a parent company could edit any of their child company websites, while employees of the child companies would only be able to see and manage their respective site.

The front-ends of the sites managed by SiteMan were also completely extracted from SiteMan itself, which was great for 2 reasons. First of all, it allowed us to more easily keep all of our clients' systems up-to-date in that we were just updating SiteMan and not touching their presentation layer. Secondly, it also allowed us to launch new campaigns and designs for clients very quickly without touching the content management system.

When we deployed SiteMan for a client it came with a core group of tools like user management, web page editing, file management, audit logs, etc.  From there, custom tools could be added as plugins.  These tools included functionality like, announcements, events, careers, photo galleries, stores, social networking, etc.

We also built SiteMan in a way that allowed users to customize their tool layout. Any user could pick which tools they used the most and arrange them in a way to get a quick snapshot of the exact data that they were interested in. Tools could be added, removed, or sorted at any time - and everything remained just as they left it on their next visit.  

This application was very Javascript heavy, making extensive use AJAX, dialog windows, and WYSIWYG editing.  As such, we had minimal page loads which provided a very streamlined experience for our clients.

I am very proud and excited to have worked with such a great team on this app.  It was so versatile and simple to keep pushing forward.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/napa-sales-driver/" data-v-1f91f03d>NAPA Sales Driver</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-02-02" data-v-1f91f03d>February 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/e-commerce/" data-v-1f91f03d>E-Commerce</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-1f91f03d>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-1f91f03d>JSON</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/payflow-pro/" data-v-1f91f03d>Payflow Pro</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/paypal/" data-v-1f91f03d>PayPal</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/scraping/" data-v-1f91f03d>Scraping</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/napa-sales-driver.14f7e88.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/napa-sales-driver.a3aa19b.gif" alt="Screenshot of NAPA Sales Driver" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Edwards Graphics Arts (a partner to NAPA) hired our company to build a web application for distributing posters and flyers to NAPA's retail stores.

I built a web application to help streamline this process and eliminate phone ordering.  This app allowed Edwards Graphic Arts to upload and edit designs for the stores to order.  Retail store managers could then visit the site and order promotional products that fit their demographic.

Apple quickly became aware of this problem and released an iTunes remote for iOS. However, at the time I didn't have any iOS devices and I couldn't justify spending a few hundred dollars for an ipod touch/iphone music remote. As such, I decided to build a remote of my own.

Using PHP and AppleScript to communicate to iTunes, I was able to whip up a super light web-based remote that ran on my Mac.  With "LAMP" running locally, I could visit the IP of my Mac from any device on my internal network and navigate my songs.

At the time, I used this to switch songs via my blackberry, sidekick, a PSP, or even our Nintendo Wii.

They came to my company, Red 5 Interactive, seeking a corporate website.

My company had already built and launched this site by the time I began working on it, so my job was simply to enhance some features on both the admin and the front-end.

Glimcher wanted a near real-time display of their stock price on the homepage. However, there weren't any great services to grab this information at the time, so I built a CRON scheduled script to scrape a couple quote sites and grab their stock price.  Whenever the price was successfully grabbed, the price was written to a local file that was read by the website.

Glimcher also wanted real-time stats on their leasing informational pages, so I added some functionality to display updates on leasable square feet, property count, etc.

Finally, they wanted to be able to quickly show/hide all dynamic content on their website. I added some simple toggling as well as drag/drop sorting to any and all data in the CMS.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/team-46/" data-v-1f91f03d>Team 46</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2008-03-27" data-v-1f91f03d>March 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/team-46.b6f946f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/team-46.7d05f7a.gif" alt="Screenshot of Team 46" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Team 46 is a group of service and avionics specialists working at the Des Moines Flying Service (DMFS). They hired our company, Red 5 Interactive, to make a micro-site for their technicians.

The Team 46 micro site was pretty straight forward. They needed a way to blog, manage case studies, take service requests, and upload photos. For the blog, I simply installed an internal blog plugin that I'd previously built. Everything else in the CMS was custom programmed.

There was nothing crazy about this app, but everything was built and deployed very smoothly.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/the-bellevue/" data-v-1f91f03d>The Bellevue</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2008-03-01" data-v-1f91f03d>March 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/scriptaculous/" data-v-1f91f03d>script.aculo.us</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/the-bellevue.2a2dfbd.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/the-bellevue.df4f27f.gif" alt="Screenshot of The Bellevue" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>The Bellevue is a building located in downtown Philadelphia that houses restaurants, shops, and a hotel.

I was the main programmer for this project while working with Red 5 Interactive.

Our designer and front end developer took care of most of the design and html build-out. I was in charge of modeling and building the actual application and content management system.

The primary function of the site was to display all of Countryside's current RV inventory.

Countryside could add a large amount of detail as well as upload multiple photos of a given RV.  We've also implemented a "Buyers Gallery" that allowed some visible interaction with Countryside's user base.  When someone bought an RV from Countryside, they'd be featured on the website with their new camper.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/515-alive/" data-v-1f91f03d>515 Alive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2006-07-25" data-v-1f91f03d>July 2006</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/515-alive.f98b258.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/515-alive.e42b0ba.gif" alt="Screenshot of 515 Alive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>515 Alive is an urban music festival that takes place in Des Moines, IA.

The site's simplicity was largely due to the very short deadline and last minute event changes.

I got to learn perl and the magic of including reusable .nav files for easy, DRY navigation manipulation.

My main duty was to fix old links, remove unwanted content, add new content, and update various items throughout.  Due to such a large amount of changes, I ended up recoding most of the site from scratch.  Everything except for the RESnet (student intranet) section of the website was my work.  At the time, if you saw a little stylized "x" in the footer the bottom of the page - I programmed it.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article></div></div></div> <footer data-v-2070be56><div data-v-2070be56>
