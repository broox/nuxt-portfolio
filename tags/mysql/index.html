Its primary purpose is to catalog my life and allow me to play with various APIs and web development technologies.

I moved the entire site from a LAMP stack to a server-side-rendered (SSR) Nuxt.js application that relies completely on the Broox API to power its content.

I chose Nuxt and SSR in order to keep my SEO and open graph / social sharing meta tags intact while still providing a speedy, asynchronous client-side browsing experience.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>7 previous versions <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v7 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2012</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.364d79a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.54d40e2.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>After learning about responsive web design during the Obama campaign, I rebuilt the front-end of derek.broox.com to be leaner and work better on mobile devices.

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.

Visually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.

With the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v4 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2004</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.80c98f7.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.fd825be.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was simply a reason to learn more about design with Cascading Style Sheets.  

Though this design did include a couple back-end changes, I focused mainly on design.  I definitely accomplished what I set out for in that I learned a great deal about using CSS effectively.

Major back-end code additions included tagging and paging for photos.

Throughout this design's life there were several add-ons made.  Some were back-end changes, most were content changes.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v3 <span data-v-eac61cc4>September 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.cc1cf7f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.4d424b1.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was mostly just content and design changes.

Prior to that my blog resided at www.broox.com.

This version was mostly just  content and design changes.

I built many of the endpoints and models for interacting with cars, photos, events, other users, search, etc.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/call-tool/" data-v-5a1319b8>Call Tool</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2012-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2012</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-5a1319b8>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/python/" data-v-5a1319b8>Python</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/call-tool.98108e2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/call-tool.0bf3dcd.gif" alt="Screenshot of Call Tool" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Call Tool is a phone canvassing web application used by both Obama for America and the DNC. In its simplest form, it provided volunteers with a potential voter to call and a relevant script to read. The volunteer could then record the answers from the potential voter, which were used to learn more about how the campaign should be operating or targeting individuals.

Underneath its shell, Call Tool had a fairly complex architecture that proxied all of its data through our Narwhal API and interfaced with a Voter Checkout Service API and synced with 2 of the campaign's vendors.

I architected and built the Call Tool web application and its communication with the Narwhal API from the ground up. I also extended several parts of the Voter Checkout Service to make it more performant, tighten protection against fraudulent callers, and better integrate with our vendors. As I took on other tasks on the campaign, I worked with other engineers and oversaw all development on the application.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/voting-location-lookup/" data-v-5a1319b8>Voting Location Lookup</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2012-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2012</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/python/" data-v-5a1319b8>Python</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/voting-location-lookup.043ef76.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/voting-location-lookup.1f250c6.gif" alt="Screenshot of Voting Location Lookup" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>The 2012 Obama Re-election campaign was a firm believer in that the more voters who turn-out to vote the more likely Democrats are to win the election. With that, the campaign put a huge effort into cataloging voting locations and making sure voters had the tools they needed to find these locations.

As the lead engineer of voter contact I architected and built the data layers, integration tools, and APIs to allow client applications to get at the data. I worked very closely with our data team, the DNC, voting location experts, and our front-end team.

Despite the incredible challenges that came with the constantly evolving, incomplete/disorganized data and different laws/rules in each state, we built a comprehensive, nation-wide election day lookup tool. In addition to that, we built the first ever nation-wide "early vote" lookup tools.

Not only was this data available via online lookup tools, it also integrated with DNC applications and allowed our phone canvassing applications to automatically display relevant voting locations for the canvassed voter.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/narwhal/" data-v-5a1319b8>Narwhal</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2012-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2012</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/api-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>API Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/python/" data-v-5a1319b8>Python</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/narwhal.6ef76fe.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/narwhal.5e9cdfd.gif" alt="Screenshot of Narwhal" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Narwhal was the famous technology infrastructure behind Barack Obama's 2012 Re-election campaign. It was a Python-based interface and integration layer that allowed us to unify the disconnected pieces of what we knew about voters, volunteers, event-goers, voting locations, etc. I was one of the top 5 contributors to the Narwhal project.

The integration side was a small web layer that handled syncing data with our vendors in real-time. Incoming data was saved to a local database and then became queued via SQS for translation and loading (by our integration workers) into the Narwhal interface layer. Here, I extended existing integrations and built some parts to sync voter applicant and precinct data.

The interface side allowed us to use this unified data to quickly build dozens of client applications for various tasks across the campaign. I spent most of my time in Narwhal building and extending models and endpoints to support client application needs. The pieces I worked on helped support pollster surveys, phone canvassing, volunteer organizing, image processing, voting location lookup, incident tracking, etc.

I also built a thin Ruby Gem that allowed our ruby based API consumer applications to quickly and easily interface with the Narwhal API.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/debate-watch/" data-v-5a1319b8>Debate Watch</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2011-12-05" data-v-5a1319b8>December 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/debate-watch.bed4574.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/debate-watch.6ed4a01.gif" alt="Screenshot of Debate Watch" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Debate Watch was a web application loosely based on Planned Parenthood's "Pledge a Protestor" program. The basic idea is that you make your opposition pay for negative actions by allowing your supporters to pledge money each time the opposition attempts slander.

With Debate Watch, we took some of the Republican candidates' favorite demeaning terms and promoted them on our site along with some fact checking. Obama supporters could then pledge to donate a certain amount of money each time a given word was said during the debate, and of course put a max cap on their donation in case something got out of control.

We had a team of word trackers stuffed in a room listening to the debate and tallying the terms in real-time. On the website's front-end the words would then re-arrange and scale in real-time as our pledgers watched.

I built the entire back-end of the application along with the word tracker and a small JSON API for consumption by our front-end team.

This application was built primarily as an experiment to test some of our scaling and payment infrastructure but managed to be quite fun and also earned us tens of thousands of dollars early on.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/artworks/" data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2011-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/artworks.96a0456.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/artworks.655d08d.gif" alt="Screenshot of Artworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks was a web application that allowed Obama supporters to vote on items in a contest.

I built the front-end from the ground up, added several new features in both the front and back end (including Facebook connect, better registration process, etc), and worked closely with our other part-time engineer on the completely rewritten javascript timeline widget.

Most of my work on 2.0 was related to bug fixes, client support, updating ad providers, or updating the widget to support new video players and sources.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div></div></div> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/smithson-woodworks/" data-v-5a1319b8>Smithson Woodworks</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-12-28" data-v-5a1319b8>December 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/blueprint/" data-v-5a1319b8>Blueprint</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/flickr-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Flickr API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/wordpress/" data-v-5a1319b8>Wordpress</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.b5eeb21.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.01804ae.gif" alt="Screenshot of Smithson Woodworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Smithson Woodworks is a side project that was run by my cousin-in-law, Jon Smithson.

Mary hired my friend Mindy Hoskin as her designer - and Mindy approached me to bring her designs to life.

Having a small web budget and not a lot of time, I used this opportunity to brush up my WordPress skills.

I was able to build Mindy's designs out into a WordPress template and still keep a lot of the custom functionality that Mary wanted.

Along with her blog, Mary also wanted a lot of multimedia - photos, video, a music player, show times, downloads, etc.

For photos, I was able to customize one of the many WordPress Flickr plugins to work with Mindy's design.

Show times and the Music player were powered by Mary's ReverbNation account.  To make show times work, I hooked her ReverbNation calendar RSS feed to FeedBurner BuzzBoost and embedded the generated BuzzBoost into her blog accordingly.

Combined with Mary's active social networking, I think we were successful in getting all of her info in front of an audience in an elegant way.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/sc-automotive/" data-v-5a1319b8>S & C Automotive</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-02-11" data-v-5a1319b8>February 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-5a1319b8>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/extjs/" data-v-5a1319b8>ExtJS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-5a1319b8>JSON</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-5a1319b8>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.be6a206.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.2487f5b.gif" alt="Screenshot of S & C Automotive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>S & C Automotive is a company that provides vehicle warranties and protections to local car dealerships.

I built a web application to allow S & C to manage these protections and offer them to dealerships. The dealerships had their own accounts and could log in and select each protection that they sell.

It was originally built so that mall property owners could manage each of their mall property's websites.  However, once we realized how powerful our system was, we decided to generalize the app so that we could deploy it for all of our clients.

We rebuilt SiteMan to allow our clients to easily manage a single website or a group of websites. This way, a parent company could edit any of their child company websites, while employees of the child companies would only be able to see and manage their respective site.

The front-ends of the sites managed by SiteMan were also completely extracted from SiteMan itself, which was great for 2 reasons. First of all, it allowed us to more easily keep all of our clients' systems up-to-date in that we were just updating SiteMan and not touching their presentation layer. Secondly, it also allowed us to launch new campaigns and designs for clients very quickly without touching the content management system.

When we deployed SiteMan for a client it came with a core group of tools like user management, web page editing, file management, audit logs, etc.  From there, custom tools could be added as plugins.  These tools included functionality like, announcements, events, careers, photo galleries, stores, social networking, etc.

We also built SiteMan in a way that allowed users to customize their tool layout. Any user could pick which tools they used the most and arrange them in a way to get a quick snapshot of the exact data that they were interested in. Tools could be added, removed, or sorted at any time - and everything remained just as they left it on their next visit.  

This application was very Javascript heavy, making extensive use AJAX, dialog windows, and WYSIWYG editing.  As such, we had minimal page loads which provided a very streamlined experience for our clients.

I am very proud and excited to have worked with such a great team on this app.  It was so versatile and simple to keep pushing forward.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/five-point-studios/" data-v-5a1319b8>Five Point Studios</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2007-09-24" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2007</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/five-point-studios.2ca25a5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/five-point-studios.b4f8354.gif" alt="Screenshot of Five Point Studios" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Five point studios was a professional piercing and custom tattoo shop in Johnston, IA. I was hired to revamp their severely outdated website and built them a custom content management so the shop could manage any page as well as manage staff members and portfolios.

I incorporated one of the shop's tattoo sketches into the design along with a fancy font that they requested.

As with any website, if the visitors don't have that font installed, they won't see your fancy text. So, using PHP's GD library, I wrote functionality to dynamically load their font and create fancy title images on the fly.

The site was much more successful in allowing Five Point to showcase the incredible work that consistently came out of their shop.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/aeon-grey/" data-v-5a1319b8>Aeon Grey</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2006-05-19" data-v-5a1319b8>May 2006</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/video-production/" data-v-5a1319b8>Video Production</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/aeon-grey.addbfb5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/aeon-grey.a3fb5a7.gif" alt="Screenshot of Aeon Grey" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I built this site for Aeon Grey, a Des Moines hip hop artist, to promote both himself and his 5th solo album: Primate Curriculum.

It's the predecessor of my former <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> (www.broox.com) and <a href="/projects/brooksfsw/">BrooksFSW</a> community sites.

After I came up with the name and domain, I decided that rather than customizing a prebuilt system, I wanted to build this site from scratch. Developing the entire site myself was another great learning experience and paid off numerous times; I had full control and a great understanding of the system, so I could easily add on, fix bugs, and rebuild sections.

One of the more fun parts of SolidGrind was the "feature pic" system. It allowed users to upload photos to be reviewed by the administrators that I'd hired. The uploaded photos were queued in a database and could be viewed/approved by administrators. Upon approval, the website would automatically size/scale the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to it, create a thumbnail, store it in the database, and feature the picture on the homepage until a new photo was chosen. In addition, I designed it so that each picture had to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gave everyone a fair amount of time on our front page.

Besides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 data-v-5a1319b8>v2 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-5a1319b8>In 2006, I re-released Solid Grind to get away from publishing broader extreme sports content and focus on the grind shoe scene. There were so many other extreme sports sites with a full staff dedicated to maintaining them, but no one had this thorough of a website dedicated to the grind shoe scene.

I worked with Nicole Sutherland on the design of this version, which turned out great for the content being delivered.

The new version of the site was much more complete, the code was much more efficient, and photo manipulation was handled much better.  With the initial version of SolidGrind I was very proud of the photo management system - this system was much cleaner and much more versatile in that most image manipulation was handled on the fly.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>1 previous version <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v1 <span data-v-eac61cc4>May 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.459171a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.7bdcc34.gif" alt="Screenshot of Solid Grind" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>The first version of SolidGrind was dedicated to several types of extreme sports.

It was a site that allowed users to download wallpapers for their early 2000s color screened mobile phones. 

At the time there were several sites offering this service however nearly all of them only supported one type of phone or charged money for each wallpaper downloaded (usually $1.00 per wallpaper). Wireless Wallpapers allowed users to download unlimited wallpapers for free, which were available for several types of phones. The free wallpapers had a tiny "wirelesswallpapers" watermarks near the bottom of the image, however if the user paid a small fee each month, they could get more features (such as private wallpapers) and the watermark was removed. In addition to this, I added functionality to allow users to upload their own images to the website which gave me the ability to let the site run itself. The website automatically resized the uploaded user images to fit various mobile screen sizes and printed my watermark to the image. The site was a huge success and learning experience. The first day it was online it received 7,000 hits and had nearly 100 users. After the first week there were nearly 50,000 hits and 500 users.  Upon selling the site, I had over 24,000 users and received over 3,200,000 hits.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/james-h-laas-company/" data-v-5a1319b8>James H.

At the time, it was one of the largest, most complex, and complete systems that I'd built. 

Prior to my development, they made all of their updates by updating static HTML files - a content management system was very much needed. They had a huge amount of content and product information that became quite redundant in the way that they were displaying it. 

I designed a more aesthetically pleasing site powered by a PHP/MySQL back-end. With the new design, I concentrated mostly on the ease of navigation and finding vital information quickly, which was successfully attained. Their site became completely free of managing and uploading static files and was updateable via the CMS that I created. The database proved to be very useful as the James Laas company wrote several articles per month. This site was also the home of the first site wide search engines that I'd built. Jhlaas.com was a huge success and a great learning experience.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/lujack-intranet/" data-v-5a1319b8>Lujack Intranet</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2002-09-26" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/lujack-intranet.7f57eaa.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/lujack-intranet.70b7d4a.gif" alt="Screenshot of Lujack Intranet" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I held an internship at Lujack's Northpark Auto Plaza for the month of September 2002.

It is probably my favorite due to the tight deadline and how well everything worked out. First of all, I had a 4-day deadline on this project. Cornell introduced a new marketing scheme to give students information about the college, which was titled "The Simple Truth." The college had hundreds of pamphlets printed out, which they would send to everyone who visited truth.cornellcollege.edu. On top of that we even had an advertisement going into U.S. News, which had a link to the site I was supposed to build (hence the short deadline).

The site was only to be 1 page long, had to open in a static sized window, and needed to have a PHP based form to collect data and insert information into a database.  On top of all of that, they wanted flash animation for the header.  The screenshot pictured is simply of the flash animation.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/spanish-flashcards/" data-v-5a1319b8>Spanish Flashcards</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2002-01-25" data-v-5a1319b8>January 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.dd6664b.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.30de5ba.gif" alt="Screenshot of Spanish Flashcards" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I made this web application for a computer science class at Cornell. One of the projects suggested by our syllabus was a flashcard program written in the language of our choice. I chose PHP/MySQL in a heartbeat.

The program allowed users to choose whether they wanted to test their vocabulary from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English. I wrote functionality that retrieves a random word from the database every time they choose a new card. Once a card is selected it is cached and marked as 'viewed'. This would make sure the program goes through every card before it repeats one of the previous ones. It was also designed so the user could choose which type of words they wanted to learn. They could select from adjectives, nouns, verbs, or all at once.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/broox-extreme/" data-v-5a1319b8>Broox Extreme</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2001-10-24" data-v-5a1319b8>October 2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.9eed1b2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.1071860.gif" alt="Screenshot of Broox Extreme" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Broox Extreme was the former version of <a href="/projects/solid-grind/">SolidGrind.com</a>. It was an extreme sports website that included 6 categories: bmx, inline, scooter, skateboard, snowboard, and soap shoes. Each section had the latest news and information along with user submitted photos and videos. 

I hired several authors who specialized in at least one category of the site to help me keep everyone informed of what's going on. 

Almost a year after the site was released (October 2001), broox.com received over 700,000 hits and had nearly 700 registered users. Upon closing, the site was just shy of 1 million hits. 

YM (Your Magazine) found this site and contacted me in order to feature me and some of my "Soaping Buddies." They flew out from New York to do a day long photoshoot of us sliding on handrails, and we were all featured in the April, 2002 of YM magazine!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/brooksfsw/" data-v-5a1319b8>BrooksFSW</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2000-09-01" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2000</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/brooksfsw.99ed790.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/brooksfsw.917d192.gif" alt="Screenshot of BrooksFSW" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>BrooksFSW was a site dedicated to Soap Shoes, a company that makes shoes capable of sliding across objects such as handrails, benches, etc.  The activity of "soaping" is very similar to grinding with inline skates or skateboards.  I did promotional work for Soap Shoes for several years and this site was a huge part of that.

BrooksFSW was a portal site using PHP Nuke to develop a community for "Soapers."  It kept users informed on the latest news and happenings with the company.  It also kept everyone involved in friendly competition with photos, polls, forums, and videos.

This was the first site I ran that used an extensive PHP and MySQL back-end and was an excellent learning experience for me. My mentor, Harper Reed, helped tremendously with the initial setup and training. It was released in September 2000 and integrated into <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> in October 2001.  During that year it received nearly 620,000 hits and had 800 registered users.  The site also had 441 news articles published and over 6,000 comments on those articles.

BrooksFSW received some great recognition from large medias such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, The Mount Vernon Sun, The Rock Island Dispatch, and the Cedar Rapids Gazette.
