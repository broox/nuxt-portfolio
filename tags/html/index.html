Its primary purpose is to catalog my life and allow me to play with various APIs and web development technologies.

I moved the entire site from a LAMP stack to a server-side-rendered (SSR) Nuxt.js application that relies completely on the Broox API to power its content.

I chose Nuxt and SSR in order to keep my SEO and open graph / social sharing meta tags intact while still providing a speedy, asynchronous client-side browsing experience.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 class="toggle" data-v-1f91f03d>7 previous versions <span data-v-1f91f03d></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-1f91f03d><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v7 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2012</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.364d79a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.54d40e2.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>After learning about responsive web design during the Obama campaign, I rebuilt the front-end of derek.broox.com to be leaner and work better on mobile devices.

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.

Visually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.

With the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v4 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2004</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.80c98f7.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.fd825be.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was simply a reason to learn more about design with Cascading Style Sheets.  

Though this design did include a couple back-end changes, I focused mainly on design.  I definitely accomplished what I set out for in that I learned a great deal about using CSS effectively.

Major back-end code additions included tagging and paging for photos.

Throughout this design's life there were several add-ons made.  Some were back-end changes, most were content changes.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v3 <span data-v-eac61cc4>September 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.cc1cf7f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.4d424b1.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was mostly just content and design changes.

This version was mostly just  content and design changes.

It's a super simple PHP/MySQL CRUD application based off of an ORM and Model framework that I built after learning Rails in 2008. The app itself barely has any features but I published the code publicly to show some friends my simple PHP framework.

Today, I'd just use a damned google docs spreadsheet to track this stuff.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><a href="https://github.com/broox/simple-auto-service" target="_blank" data-v-1f91f03d>https://github.com/broox/simple-auto-service</a></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/des-moines-alive/" data-v-1f91f03d>Des Moines Alive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2011-04-30" data-v-1f91f03d>April 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/foursquare-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Foursquare API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/google-maps-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Google Maps API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/jquery/" data-v-1f91f03d>jQuery</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-1f91f03d>JSON</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/simple-geo-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Simple Geo API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/twitter-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Twitter API</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-alive-v2.94a37e6.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-alive-v2.6f3c147.gif" alt="Screenshot of Des Moines Alive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Des Moines Alive is a personal project that my friend Nick Leeper and I built to help Des Moines Area folks find awesome local bars and restaurants.

We built an incredible web-based tool that allowed users to create, share, embed and collaborate on interactive timelines that integrated video, audio, images, text, social media, geolocation and of course, accurate timestamps. Timeline viewers could pan around and zoom into these timelines for a very nice, visually engaging experience.

Version 2 was a couple years old.  The design was dated, its timeline widget was built on the YUI library, and was generally inefficient.

Dipity 3's goal was to update the look, improve the widget's efficiency, support HTML5 guidelines, function on mobile devices, and provide several new features.

I built the front-end from the ground up, added several new features in both the front and back end (including Facebook connect, better registration process, etc), and worked closely with our other part-time engineer on the completely rewritten javascript timeline widget.

I spent a lot of time making sure that the new Dipity timeline widget worked on mobile devices such as androids, iPhones, and iPads.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 class="toggle" data-v-1f91f03d>1 previous version <span data-v-1f91f03d></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-1f91f03d><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-1f91f03d><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v2 <span data-v-eac61cc4>January 2010</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.2c33da0.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.25080a2.gif" alt="Screenshot of Dipity" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>Dipity was originally a Facebook app. Version 2 was its reincarnation as a full fledged web application.

I was actually hired at Dipity to help phase out Dipity 2 and reinvent the software.

During the building of Dipity 3, things on Dipity 2 obviously needed maintained. Most of my work on 2.0 was related to bug fixes, client support, updating ad providers, or updating the widget to support new video players and sources.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div></div></div> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/smithson-woodworks/" data-v-1f91f03d>Smithson Woodworks</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-12-28" data-v-1f91f03d>December 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/blueprint/" data-v-1f91f03d>Blueprint</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/flickr-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Flickr API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/wordpress/" data-v-1f91f03d>Wordpress</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.b5eeb21.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.01804ae.gif" alt="Screenshot of Smithson Woodworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Smithson Woodworks is a side project that was run by my cousin-in-law, Jon Smithson.

I was able to build Mindy's designs out into a WordPress template and still keep a lot of the custom functionality that Mary wanted.

Along with her blog, Mary also wanted a lot of multimedia - photos, video, a music player, show times, downloads, etc.

For photos, I was able to customize one of the many WordPress Flickr plugins to work with Mindy's design.

Show times and the Music player were powered by Mary's ReverbNation account.  To make show times work, I hooked her ReverbNation calendar RSS feed to FeedBurner BuzzBoost and embedded the generated BuzzBoost into her blog accordingly.

Combined with Mary's active social networking, I think we were successful in getting all of her info in front of an audience in an elegant way.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/holiday-ecards/" data-v-1f91f03d>Holiday eCards</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-11-30" data-v-1f91f03d>November 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-1f91f03d>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/xml/" data-v-1f91f03d>XML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/holiday-ecards-v2.dc7e5a8.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/holiday-ecards-v2.fddfbf1.gif" alt="Screenshot of Holiday eCards" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>This is a microsite that I built as a marketing tool for malls owned by PREIT.

The former host of michaelannett.com was not very cooperative in the site transition - so we had an interesting time getting Michael's content for him.

To get Michael's site, we wrote an internal app called <a href="/projects/site-spider/">Site Spider</a> to crawl his existing site, save all the pages, their images, stylesheets, javascripts, etc - all while preserving the links and folder structure.  Once I successfully crawled and downloaded this site, I put this app into our internal Content Management application, <a href="/projects/siteman/">SiteMan</a>.

I also built a couple custom SiteMan plugins, which included a photo gallery and online store management.

The store they wanted was fairly small, however, no matter the size, building an online store is quite an effort.

After launch, Michael was able to easily update news, photo galleries, results, schedules, general web page content at anytime, and could sell his gear online.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/sc-automotive/" data-v-1f91f03d>S & C Automotive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-02-11" data-v-1f91f03d>February 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ajax/" data-v-1f91f03d>AJAX</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/extjs/" data-v-1f91f03d>ExtJS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/json/" data-v-1f91f03d>JSON</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.be6a206.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/sc-automotive.2487f5b.gif" alt="Screenshot of S & C Automotive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>S & C Automotive is a company that provides vehicle warranties and protections to local car dealerships.

It was originally built so that mall property owners could manage each of their mall property's websites.  However, once we realized how powerful our system was, we decided to generalize the app so that we could deploy it for all of our clients.

We rebuilt SiteMan to allow our clients to easily manage a single website or a group of websites. This way, a parent company could edit any of their child company websites, while employees of the child companies would only be able to see and manage their respective site.

The front-ends of the sites managed by SiteMan were also completely extracted from SiteMan itself, which was great for 2 reasons. First of all, it allowed us to more easily keep all of our clients' systems up-to-date in that we were just updating SiteMan and not touching their presentation layer. Secondly, it also allowed us to launch new campaigns and designs for clients very quickly without touching the content management system.

When we deployed SiteMan for a client it came with a core group of tools like user management, web page editing, file management, audit logs, etc.  From there, custom tools could be added as plugins.  These tools included functionality like, announcements, events, careers, photo galleries, stores, social networking, etc.

We also built SiteMan in a way that allowed users to customize their tool layout. Any user could pick which tools they used the most and arrange them in a way to get a quick snapshot of the exact data that they were interested in. Tools could be added, removed, or sorted at any time - and everything remained just as they left it on their next visit.  

This application was very Javascript heavy, making extensive use AJAX, dialog windows, and WYSIWYG editing.  As such, we had minimal page loads which provided a very streamlined experience for our clients.

I am very proud and excited to have worked with such a great team on this app.  It was so versatile and simple to keep pushing forward.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/des-moines-broomball/" data-v-1f91f03d>Des Moines Broomball</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2009-01-06" data-v-1f91f03d>January 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-broomball.3542a71.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-broomball.794e1cb.gif" alt="Screenshot of Des Moines Broomball" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>I am a broomball player. Broomball is a sport similar to hockey but a bit more recreational.

Once my Broomball league caught wind of me being a well-connected, tech savvy guy, they nominated me to be the Marketing Director.

As marketing director my main purpose was to help promote the league - and what better way to do that than to build a fancy website.

Not having hardly any time to devote to this project, I decided to try out a product that I'd heard a bit about, called Drupal.

The Drupal Content Management System was a pretty great little app.  I literally had a community site up and running within an hour.  The Drupal community had written so many modules, that I didn't have to write a single line of code to get the site off the ground.

After installing a handful of modules, a bit of layout tweaking, and modifying a tiny bit of PHP, we had a completely functional site.

I even got the help of designer Kathryn Downing to whip up that logo in a matter of about 25 minutes.

I wouldn't use Drupal for everything, but it was definitely an excellent solution for this project. The site helped the league gain players and teams for our regional tournaments.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/signs-plus/" data-v-1f91f03d>Signs Plus</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2008-09-10" data-v-1f91f03d>September 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/xml/" data-v-1f91f03d>XML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/signs-plus.7e6dd4f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/signs-plus.be5f77c.gif" alt="Screenshot of Signs Plus" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Signs Plus is a Des Moines area company who is responsible for some of Iowa's most impressive signage.

Our designer took care of the visual aspects, while I was in charge of modeling and content management.

The major function of the admin panel was to allow Signs Plus to upload photos of their work.  The images were dynamically resized in several ways to fit the flash-based home page, as the rest of the site.

Being that the homepage was flash, I also built some dynamic XML endpoints to feed data to power the animations.

It was awesome until a terrible song would come on and I'd have to run upstairs to skip to a better tune.

Apple quickly became aware of this problem and released an iTunes remote for iOS. However, at the time I didn't have any iOS devices and I couldn't justify spending a few hundred dollars for an ipod touch/iphone music remote. As such, I decided to build a remote of my own.

Using PHP and AppleScript to communicate to iTunes, I was able to whip up a super light web-based remote that ran on my Mac.  With "LAMP" running locally, I could visit the IP of my Mac from any device on my internal network and navigate my songs.

At the time, I used this to switch songs via my blackberry, sidekick, a PSP, or even our Nintendo Wii.  It was great for parties!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/justin-marks-racing/" data-v-1f91f03d>Justin Marks Racing</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2008-05-08" data-v-1f91f03d>May 2008</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/flickr-api/" data-v-1f91f03d>Flickr API</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/ruby-on-rails/" data-v-1f91f03d>Ruby on Rails</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/xml/" data-v-1f91f03d>XML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/justin-marks-racing.f292fe0.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/justin-marks-racing.de024ab.gif" alt="Screenshot of Justin Marks Racing" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>The company I work for, Red 5 Interactive was hired to build a site for NASCAR truck driver, Justin Marks.

The primary function of the site was to display all of Countryside's current RV inventory.

Countryside could add a large amount of detail as well as upload multiple photos of a given RV.  We've also implemented a "Buyers Gallery" that allowed some visible interaction with Countryside's user base.

I incorporated one of the shop's tattoo sketches into the design along with a fancy font that they requested.

As with any website, if the visitors don't have that font installed, they won't see your fancy text. So, using PHP's GD library, I wrote functionality to dynamically load their font and create fancy title images on the fly.

The site was much more successful in allowing Five Point to showcase the incredible work that consistently came out of their shop.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/515-alive/" data-v-1f91f03d>515 Alive</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2006-07-25" data-v-1f91f03d>July 2006</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/515-alive.f98b258.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/515-alive.e42b0ba.gif" alt="Screenshot of 515 Alive" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>515 Alive is an urban music festival that takes place in Des Moines, IA.

It's the predecessor of my former <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> (www.broox.com) and <a href="/projects/brooksfsw/">BrooksFSW</a> community sites.

After I came up with the name and domain, I decided that rather than customizing a prebuilt system, I wanted to build this site from scratch. Developing the entire site myself was another great learning experience and paid off numerous times; I had full control and a great understanding of the system, so I could easily add on, fix bugs, and rebuild sections.

One of the more fun parts of SolidGrind was the "feature pic" system. It allowed users to upload photos to be reviewed by the administrators that I'd hired. The uploaded photos were queued in a database and could be viewed/approved by administrators. Upon approval, the website would automatically size/scale the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to it, create a thumbnail, store it in the database, and feature the picture on the homepage until a new photo was chosen. In addition, I designed it so that each picture had to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gave everyone a fair amount of time on our front page.

Besides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-1f91f03d><h3 data-v-1f91f03d>v2 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-1f91f03d>In 2006, I re-released Solid Grind to get away from publishing broader extreme sports content and focus on the grind shoe scene. There were so many other extreme sports sites with a full staff dedicated to maintaining them, but no one had this thorough of a website dedicated to the grind shoe scene.

I worked with Nicole Sutherland on the design of this version, which turned out great for the content being delivered.

The new version of the site was much more complete, the code was much more efficient, and photo manipulation was handled much better.

It was a site that allowed users to download wallpapers for their early 2000s color screened mobile phones. 

At the time there were several sites offering this service however nearly all of them only supported one type of phone or charged money for each wallpaper downloaded (usually $1.00 per wallpaper). Wireless Wallpapers allowed users to download unlimited wallpapers for free, which were available for several types of phones. The free wallpapers had a tiny "wirelesswallpapers" watermarks near the bottom of the image, however if the user paid a small fee each month, they could get more features (such as private wallpapers) and the watermark was removed. In addition to this, I added functionality to allow users to upload their own images to the website which gave me the ability to let the site run itself. The website automatically resized the uploaded user images to fit various mobile screen sizes and printed my watermark to the image. The site was a huge success and learning experience. The first day it was online it received 7,000 hits and had nearly 100 users. After the first week there were nearly 50,000 hits and 500 users.  Upon selling the site, I had over 24,000 users and received over 3,200,000 hits.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/james-h-laas-company/" data-v-1f91f03d>James H.

At the time, it was one of the largest, most complex, and complete systems that I'd built. 

Prior to my development, they made all of their updates by updating static HTML files - a content management system was very much needed. They had a huge amount of content and product information that became quite redundant in the way that they were displaying it. 

I designed a more aesthetically pleasing site powered by a PHP/MySQL back-end. With the new design, I concentrated mostly on the ease of navigation and finding vital information quickly, which was successfully attained. Their site became completely free of managing and uploading static files and was updateable via the CMS that I created. The database proved to be very useful as the James Laas company wrote several articles per month. This site was also the home of the first site wide search engines that I'd built. Jhlaas.com was a huge success and a great learning experience.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/kronus-films/" data-v-1f91f03d>Kronus Films</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2002-11-02" data-v-1f91f03d>November 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/kronus-films.74f6922.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/kronus-films.eaeece4.gif" alt="Screenshot of Kronus Films" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>This is a design that I completed while working for NaTa2 Productions.

It is probably my favorite due to the tight deadline and how well everything worked out. First of all, I had a 4-day deadline on this project. Cornell introduced a new marketing scheme to give students information about the college, which was titled "The Simple Truth." The college had hundreds of pamphlets printed out, which they would send to everyone who visited truth.cornellcollege.edu. On top of that we even had an advertisement going into U.S. News, which had a link to the site I was supposed to build (hence the short deadline).

The site was only to be 1 page long, had to open in a static sized window, and needed to have a PHP based form to collect data and insert information into a database.  On top of all of that, they wanted flash animation for the header.  The screenshot pictured is simply of the flash animation.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/spanish-flashcards/" data-v-1f91f03d>Spanish Flashcards</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2002-01-25" data-v-1f91f03d>January 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.dd6664b.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.30de5ba.gif" alt="Screenshot of Spanish Flashcards" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>I made this web application for a computer science class at Cornell. One of the projects suggested by our syllabus was a flashcard program written in the language of our choice. I chose PHP/MySQL in a heartbeat.

The program allowed users to choose whether they wanted to test their vocabulary from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English. I wrote functionality that retrieves a random word from the database every time they choose a new card. Once a card is selected it is cached and marked as 'viewed'. This would make sure the program goes through every card before it repeats one of the previous ones. It was also designed so the user could choose which type of words they wanted to learn. They could select from adjectives, nouns, verbs, or all at once.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/broox-extreme/" data-v-1f91f03d>Broox Extreme</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2001-10-24" data-v-1f91f03d>October 2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-1f91f03d>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/php/" data-v-1f91f03d>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.9eed1b2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.1071860.gif" alt="Screenshot of Broox Extreme" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Broox Extreme was the former version of <a href="/projects/solid-grind/">SolidGrind.com</a>.

I did promotional work for Soap Shoes for several years and this site was a huge part of that.

BrooksFSW was a portal site using PHP Nuke to develop a community for "Soapers."  It kept users informed on the latest news and happenings with the company.  It also kept everyone involved in friendly competition with photos, polls, forums, and videos.

This was the first site I ran that used an extensive PHP and MySQL back-end and was an excellent learning experience for me. My mentor, Harper Reed, helped tremendously with the initial setup and training. It was released in September 2000 and integrated into <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> in October 2001.  During that year it received nearly 620,000 hits and had 800 registered users.  The site also had 441 news articles published and over 6,000 comments on those articles.

I was hired as a technician and web master for the 2001-2002 school year.  As technician, I was in charge of setting up and running all audio/video equipment at our events.  As web master, I had complete reign over the site.

When I first joined this group the site was programmed via Macromedia Dream Weaver and was quite simple. I rebuilt the site from scratch, giving it a more uniform, professional look that was very easy to navigate.  I also integrated some Flash animation for aesthetics.

The color scheme may not have been the best, but it was our school colors and the overall layout turned out nice.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/computing-services/" data-v-1f91f03d>Computing Services</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2001" data-v-1f91f03d>2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-1f91f03d>CSS</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-1f91f03d>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/perl/" data-v-1f91f03d>Perl</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/computing-services.0ec4050.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/computing-services.89aa4ab.gif" alt="Screenshot of Computing Services" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>While at Cornell, I worked for Computing Services - the department that managed all of Information Technology.  As part of my work-study I was hired to design a site for our department.  It was my first experience in coding websites with things other than straight HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I got to learn perl and the magic of including reusable .nav files for easy, DRY navigation manipulation.

My main duty was to fix old links, remove unwanted content, add new content, and update various items throughout.  Due to such a large amount of changes, I ended up recoding most of the site from scratch.  Everything except for the RESnet (student intranet) section of the website was my work.  At the time, if you saw a little stylized "x" in the footer the bottom of the page - I programmed it.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/advantage-group/" data-v-1f91f03d>Advantage Group</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2001" data-v-1f91f03d>2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/advantage-group.d27c10c.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/advantage-group.98bbc55.gif" alt="Screenshot of Advantage Group" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>The Advantage Group is an investment company based in Cedar Rapids Iowa.  They were a client for one of my employers and hired me to do their website.  This site was fairly simple but needed to be extremely clean, professional, and still be able to relay a large amount of information to the reader.

The site turned out just as planned and served as a great tool for The Advantage Group.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article><article data-v-1f91f03d data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-1f91f03d><h2 data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/projects/kappa-theta/" data-v-1f91f03d>Kappa Theta</a></h2> <span data-v-1f91f03d><time datetime="2000" data-v-1f91f03d>2000</time></span></header> <ul data-v-1f91f03d><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-1f91f03d>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/tags/html/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-1f91f03d>HTML</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-1f91f03d><a href="/_nuxt/img/kappa-theta.2b96e5d.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-1f91f03d><img src="/_nuxt/img/kappa-theta.570aeea.gif" alt="Screenshot of Kappa Theta" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-1f91f03d>Kappa Theta is a female social group at Cornell College - Cornell's equivalent to a Sorority.  The women of Kappa Theta hired me to design a simple informational website.  After designing the site, I trained one of the women to update the content via Macromedia Dream Weaver.

It turned out to be a very useful tool to easily communicate the message, purpose, and goals of the group.  5 years later, I ended up marrying one of them!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-1f91f03d><!----></footer></article></div></div></div> <footer data-v-2070be56><div data-v-2070be56>
