I moved the entire site from a containerized LAMP stack to a server-side-rendered (SSR) Nuxt.js application that relies completely on the <a href="/projects/broox-api/">Broox API</a> to power its content.

I chose Nuxt and SSR in order to keep my SEO and open graph / social sharing meta tags intact while still providing a speedy, asynchronous client-side browsing experience.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>7 previous versions <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v7 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2012</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.364d79a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v7.54d40e2.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>After learning about responsive web design during the Obama campaign, I rebuilt the front-end of derek.broox.com to be leaner and work better on mobile devices.

I didn't want to rewrite the site until I was absolutely sure that I was writing extremely solid code that would actually make the site function better - not just look different.

Visually there isn't a whole lot of difference between this release and version 4, however the back-end was completely rewritten.

With the complete recoding of the site I greatly enhanced several features.  A few of the those include: content tagging, photo handling, database calls, and paging. This version of the site is much much lighter, much quicker, and a lot more clean.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v4 <span data-v-eac61cc4>November 2004</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.80c98f7.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v4.fd825be.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was simply a reason to learn more about design with Cascading Style Sheets.  

Though this design did include a couple back-end changes, I focused mainly on design.  I definitely accomplished what I set out for in that I learned a great deal about using CSS effectively.

Major back-end code additions included tagging and paging for photos.

Throughout this design's life there were several add-ons made.  Some were back-end changes, most were content changes.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v3 <span data-v-eac61cc4>September 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.cc1cf7f.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/derek-broox-com-v3.4d424b1.gif" alt="Screenshot of derek.broox.com" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>This version of derek.broox.com was mostly just content and design changes.

Prior to that my blog resided at www.broox.com.

This version was mostly just  content and design changes.

So I whipped up a tiny web-app to help track and display this information. A decade later I became bored while traveling, so I decided to clean up the old app and publish the code.

It's a super simple PHP/MySQL CRUD application based off of an ORM and Model framework that I built after learning Rails in 2008. The app itself barely has any features but I published the code publicly to show some friends my simple PHP framework.

Today, I'd just use a damned google docs spreadsheet to track this stuff.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><a href="https://github.com/broox/simple-auto-service" target="_blank" data-v-5a1319b8>https://github.com/broox/simple-auto-service</a></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/artworks/" data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2011-11-06" data-v-5a1319b8>November 2011</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/facebook-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Facebook API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/artworks.96a0456.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/artworks.655d08d.gif" alt="Screenshot of Artworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Artworks was a web application that allowed Obama supporters to vote on items in a contest.

We built an incredible web-based tool that allowed users to create, share, embed and collaborate on interactive timelines that integrated video, audio, images, text, social media, geolocation and of course, accurate timestamps. Timeline viewers could pan around and zoom into these timelines for a very nice, visually engaging experience. Being that it was all built in vanilla javascript, it even worked, and was incredibly responsive, on mobile devices, ipads, etc.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 data-v-5a1319b8>v3 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-5a1319b8>Building Dipity 3 is the main reason I was hired.

Version 2 was a couple years old.  The design was dated, its timeline widget was built on the YUI library, and was generally inefficient.

Dipity 3's goal was to update the look, improve the widget's efficiency, support HTML5 guidelines, function on mobile devices, and provide several new features.

I built the front-end from the ground up, added several new features in both the front and back end (including Facebook connect, better registration process, etc), and worked closely with our other part-time engineer on the completely rewritten javascript timeline widget.

I spent a lot of time making sure that the new Dipity timeline widget worked on mobile devices such as androids, iPhones, and iPads.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>1 previous version <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v2 <span data-v-eac61cc4>January 2010</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.2c33da0.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/dipity-v2.25080a2.gif" alt="Screenshot of Dipity" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>Dipity was originally a Facebook app. Version 2 was its reincarnation as a full fledged web application. It was a very impressive piece of software at the time and a huge feat to get it built. Unfortunately, I had nothing to do with any of those things... I was actually hired at Dipity to help phase out Dipity 2 and reinvent the software.

During the building of Dipity 3, things on Dipity 2 obviously needed maintained. Most of my work on 2.0 was related to bug fixes, client support, updating ad providers, or updating the widget to support new video players and sources.</div> <div class="clear" data-v-eac61cc4></div></div></div></div></div> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/smithson-woodworks/" data-v-5a1319b8>Smithson Woodworks</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-12-28" data-v-5a1319b8>December 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/blueprint/" data-v-5a1319b8>Blueprint</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/flickr-api/" data-v-5a1319b8>Flickr API</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/javascript/" data-v-5a1319b8>JavaScript</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/prototype/" data-v-5a1319b8>Prototype</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/wordpress/" data-v-5a1319b8>Wordpress</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.b5eeb21.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/smithson-woodworks.01804ae.gif" alt="Screenshot of Smithson Woodworks" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Smithson Woodworks is a side project that was run by my cousin-in-law, Jon Smithson.

Mary hired my friend Mindy Hoskin as her designer - and Mindy approached me to bring her designs to life.

Having a small web budget and not a lot of time, I used this opportunity to brush up my WordPress skills.

I was able to build Mindy's designs out into a WordPress template and still keep a lot of the custom functionality that Mary wanted.

Along with her blog, Mary also wanted a lot of multimedia - photos, video, a music player, show times, downloads, etc.

For photos, I was able to customize one of the many WordPress Flickr plugins to work with Mindy's design.

Show times and the Music player were powered by Mary's ReverbNation account.  To make show times work, I hooked her ReverbNation calendar RSS feed to FeedBurner BuzzBoost and embedded the generated BuzzBoost into her blog accordingly.

Combined with Mary's active social networking, I think we were successful in getting all of her info in front of an audience in an elegant way.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/des-moines-broomball/" data-v-5a1319b8>Des Moines Broomball</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2009-01-06" data-v-5a1319b8>January 2009</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-broomball.3542a71.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/des-moines-broomball.794e1cb.gif" alt="Screenshot of Des Moines Broomball" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I am a broomball player. Broomball is a sport similar to hockey but a bit more recreational.

Once my Broomball league caught wind of me being a well-connected, tech savvy guy, they nominated me to be the Marketing Director.

As marketing director my main purpose was to help promote the league - and what better way to do that than to build a fancy website.

Not having hardly any time to devote to this project, I decided to try out a product that I'd heard a bit about, called Drupal.

The Drupal Content Management System was a pretty great little app.  I literally had a community site up and running within an hour.  The Drupal community had written so many modules, that I didn't have to write a single line of code to get the site off the ground.

After installing a handful of modules, a bit of layout tweaking, and modifying a tiny bit of PHP, we had a completely functional site.

I even got the help of designer Kathryn Downing to whip up that logo in a matter of about 25 minutes.

I wouldn't use Drupal for everything, but it was definitely an excellent solution for this project.

It was awesome until a terrible song would come on and I'd have to run upstairs to skip to a better tune.

Apple quickly became aware of this problem and released an iTunes remote for iOS. However, at the time I didn't have any iOS devices and I couldn't justify spending a few hundred dollars for an ipod touch/iphone music remote. As such, I decided to build a remote of my own.

Using PHP and AppleScript to communicate to iTunes, I was able to whip up a super light web-based remote that ran on my Mac.  With "LAMP" running locally, I could visit the IP of my Mac from any device on my internal network and navigate my songs.

At the time, I used this to switch songs via my blackberry, sidekick, a PSP, or even our Nintendo Wii.  It was great for parties!</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/five-point-studios/" data-v-5a1319b8>Five Point Studios</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2007-09-24" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2007</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/five-point-studios.2ca25a5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/five-point-studios.b4f8354.gif" alt="Screenshot of Five Point Studios" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Five point studios was a professional piercing and custom tattoo shop in Johnston, IA. I was hired to revamp their severely outdated website and built them a custom content management so the shop could manage any page as well as manage staff members and portfolios.

I incorporated one of the shop's tattoo sketches into the design along with a fancy font that they requested.

As with any website, if the visitors don't have that font installed, they won't see your fancy text. So, using PHP's GD library, I wrote functionality to dynamically load their font and create fancy title images on the fly.

The site was much more successful in allowing Five Point to showcase the incredible work that consistently came out of their shop.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/aeon-grey/" data-v-5a1319b8>Aeon Grey</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2006-05-19" data-v-5a1319b8>May 2006</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/video-production/" data-v-5a1319b8>Video Production</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/aeon-grey.addbfb5.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/aeon-grey.a3fb5a7.gif" alt="Screenshot of Aeon Grey" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I built this site for Aeon Grey, a Des Moines hip hop artist, to promote both himself and his 5th solo album: Primate Curriculum.

The finished product enabled their customers to get the most up-to-date news to help with their regulatory decision making.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/solid-grind/" data-v-5a1319b8>Solid Grind</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2003-05-28" data-v-5a1319b8>May 2003</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/e-commerce/" data-v-5a1319b8>E-Commerce</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/image-processing/" data-v-5a1319b8>Image Processing</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/paypal/" data-v-5a1319b8>PayPal</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v2.c4a1729.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v2.78e0995.gif" alt="Screenshot of Solid Grind" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>SolidGrind is a personal project that I developed as an extreme sports / soap shoes promotional and community website. It's the predecessor of my former <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> (www.broox.com) and <a href="/projects/brooksfsw/">BrooksFSW</a> community sites.

After I came up with the name and domain, I decided that rather than customizing a prebuilt system, I wanted to build this site from scratch. Developing the entire site myself was another great learning experience and paid off numerous times; I had full control and a great understanding of the system, so I could easily add on, fix bugs, and rebuild sections.

One of the more fun parts of SolidGrind was the "feature pic" system. It allowed users to upload photos to be reviewed by the administrators that I'd hired. The uploaded photos were queued in a database and could be viewed/approved by administrators. Upon approval, the website would automatically size/scale the image, add a SolidGrind.com watermark to it, create a thumbnail, store it in the database, and feature the picture on the homepage until a new photo was chosen. In addition, I designed it so that each picture had to be featured for at least 24 hours; this gave everyone a fair amount of time on our front page.

Besides photos, the site featured news, forums, tutorials, videos, and several other things related to extreme sports.</div></div> <div class="latest" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 data-v-5a1319b8>v2 - latest version</h3> <p data-v-5a1319b8>In 2006, I re-released Solid Grind to get away from publishing broader extreme sports content and focus on the grind shoe scene. There were so many other extreme sports sites with a full staff dedicated to maintaining them, but no one had this thorough of a website dedicated to the grind shoe scene.

I worked with Nicole Sutherland on the design of this version, which turned out great for the content being delivered.

The new version of the site was much more complete, the code was much more efficient, and photo manipulation was handled much better.  With the initial version of SolidGrind I was very proud of the photo management system - this system was much cleaner and much more versatile in that most image manipulation was handled on the fly.</p></div> <div class="previous" data-v-5a1319b8><h3 class="toggle" data-v-5a1319b8>1 previous version <span data-v-5a1319b8></span></h3> <div class="versions" data-v-5a1319b8><div data-v-eac61cc4 data-v-5a1319b8><h4 data-v-eac61cc4>v1 <span data-v-eac61cc4>May 2003</span></h4> <div data-v-eac61cc4><a href="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.459171a.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-eac61cc4><img src="/_nuxt/img/solid-grind-v1.7bdcc34.gif" alt="Screenshot of Solid Grind" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-eac61cc4>The first version of SolidGrind was dedicated to several types of extreme sports.

It was a site that allowed users to download wallpapers for their early 2000s color screened mobile phones. 

At the time there were several sites offering this service however nearly all of them only supported one type of phone or charged money for each wallpaper downloaded (usually $1.00 per wallpaper). Wireless Wallpapers allowed users to download unlimited wallpapers for free, which were available for several types of phones. The free wallpapers had a tiny "wirelesswallpapers" watermarks near the bottom of the image, however if the user paid a small fee each month, they could get more features (such as private wallpapers) and the watermark was removed. In addition to this, I added functionality to allow users to upload their own images to the website which gave me the ability to let the site run itself. The website automatically resized the uploaded user images to fit various mobile screen sizes and printed my watermark to the image. The site was a huge success and learning experience. The first day it was online it received 7,000 hits and had nearly 100 users. After the first week there were nearly 50,000 hits and 500 users.  Upon selling the site, I had over 24,000 users and received over 3,200,000 hits.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/james-h-laas-company/" data-v-5a1319b8>James H.

At the time, it was one of the largest, most complex, and complete systems that I'd built. 

Prior to my development, they made all of their updates by updating static HTML files - a content management system was very much needed. They had a huge amount of content and product information that became quite redundant in the way that they were displaying it. 

I designed a more aesthetically pleasing site powered by a PHP/MySQL back-end. With the new design, I concentrated mostly on the ease of navigation and finding vital information quickly, which was successfully attained. Their site became completely free of managing and uploading static files and was updateable via the CMS that I created. The database proved to be very useful as the James Laas company wrote several articles per month. This site was also the home of the first site wide search engines that I'd built. Jhlaas.com was a huge success and a great learning experience.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/lujack-intranet/" data-v-5a1319b8>Lujack Intranet</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2002-09-26" data-v-5a1319b8>September 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/lujack-intranet.7f57eaa.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/lujack-intranet.70b7d4a.gif" alt="Screenshot of Lujack Intranet" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I held an internship at Lujack's Northpark Auto Plaza for the month of September 2002. During this month one of my projects was to build an intranet system to allow administrators to post news and happenings within the plaza. The site uses a PHP/MySQL back-end to submit news, and also to display uploaded articles. Since the people who will be administering the site don't know much about web design, I made this site as simple and fool proof as possible. They used the intranet system for quite some time and it proved to be very helpful for relaying information throughout the plaza.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/the-simple-truth-cornell-college/" data-v-5a1319b8>The Simple Truth @ Cornell College</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2002-08-01" data-v-5a1319b8>August 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/flash/" data-v-5a1319b8>Flash</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><!----> <div data-v-5a1319b8>This is one of the many sites I built while on the Cornell College student webteam. It is probably my favorite due to the tight deadline and how well everything worked out. First of all, I had a 4-day deadline on this project. Cornell introduced a new marketing scheme to give students information about the college, which was titled "The Simple Truth." The college had hundreds of pamphlets printed out, which they would send to everyone who visited truth.cornellcollege.edu. On top of that we even had an advertisement going into U.S. News, which had a link to the site I was supposed to build (hence the short deadline).

The site was only to be 1 page long, had to open in a static sized window, and needed to have a PHP based form to collect data and insert information into a database.  On top of all of that, they wanted flash animation for the header.  The screenshot pictured is simply of the flash animation.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/spanish-flashcards/" data-v-5a1319b8>Spanish Flashcards</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2002-01-25" data-v-5a1319b8>January 2002</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.dd6664b.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/spanish-flashcards.30de5ba.gif" alt="Screenshot of Spanish Flashcards" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>I made this web application for a computer science class at Cornell. One of the projects suggested by our syllabus was a flashcard program written in the language of our choice. I chose PHP/MySQL in a heartbeat.

The program allowed users to choose whether they wanted to test their vocabulary from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English. I wrote functionality that retrieves a random word from the database every time they choose a new card. Once a card is selected it is cached and marked as 'viewed'. This would make sure the program goes through every card before it repeats one of the previous ones. It was also designed so the user could choose which type of words they wanted to learn. They could select from adjectives, nouns, verbs, or all at once.</div></div> <!----> <!----> <footer data-v-5a1319b8><!----></footer></article><article data-v-5a1319b8 data-v-99fe13c8><header data-v-5a1319b8><h2 data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/projects/broox-extreme/" data-v-5a1319b8>Broox Extreme</a></h2> <span data-v-5a1319b8><time datetime="2001-10-24" data-v-5a1319b8>October 2001</time></span></header> <ul data-v-5a1319b8><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/css/" data-v-5a1319b8>CSS</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/graphic-design/" data-v-5a1319b8>Graphic Design</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/html/" data-v-5a1319b8>HTML</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/mysql/" data-v-5a1319b8>MySQL</a></li><li data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/tags/php/" aria-current="page" class="nuxt-link-exact-active nuxt-link-active" data-v-5a1319b8>PHP</a></li></ul> <div class="description" data-v-5a1319b8><a href="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.9eed1b2.png" data-v-3c0f42af data-v-5a1319b8><img src="/_nuxt/img/broox-extreme.1071860.gif" alt="Screenshot of Broox Extreme" data-v-3c0f42af></a> <div data-v-5a1319b8>Broox Extreme was the former version of <a href="/projects/solid-grind/">SolidGrind.com</a>.

Each section had the latest news and information along with user submitted photos and videos. 

I hired several authors who specialized in at least one category of the site to help me keep everyone informed of what's going on. 

Almost a year after the site was released (October 2001), broox.com received over 700,000 hits and had nearly 700 registered users. Upon closing, the site was just shy of 1 million hits. 

YM (Your Magazine) found this site and contacted me in order to feature me and some of my "Soaping Buddies."

I did promotional work for Soap Shoes for several years and this site was a huge part of that.

BrooksFSW was a portal site using PHP Nuke to develop a community for "Soapers."  It kept users informed on the latest news and happenings with the company.  It also kept everyone involved in friendly competition with photos, polls, forums, and videos.

This was the first site I ran that used an extensive PHP and MySQL back-end and was an excellent learning experience for me. My mentor, Harper Reed, helped tremendously with the initial setup and training. It was released in September 2000 and integrated into <a href="/projects/broox-extreme/">Broox Extreme</a> in October 2001.  During that year it received nearly 620,000 hits and had 800 registered users.  The site also had 441 news articles published and over 6,000 comments on those articles.

BrooksFSW received some great recognition from large medias such as the British Broadcasting Corporation, The Mount Vernon Sun, The Rock Island Dispatch, and the Cedar Rapids Gazette.
